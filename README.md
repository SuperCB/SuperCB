>X-rays  are a form of high-energy  electromagnetic radiation , with  wavelengths  shorter than those of  ultraviolet  rays and longer than those of  gamma rays  – roughly in the range of 0.01 to 10  nanometres . X-rays were discovered by German scientist  Wilhelm Röntgen  in 1895, who named them  X-radiation  to signify an unknown type of radiation. X-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, and X-ray  radiography  is widely used in  medical diagnostics . This medical significance was noticed by Röntgen shortly after he discovered X-rays; this print, titled  Hand mit Ringen  (Hand with Rings), is a print of his first medical X-ray, taken of his wife Anna Bertha Ludwig's hand in December 1895.
