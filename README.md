>George Roper  was a four-masted iron  barque  that was built for service between England and Australia, launching from  Liverpool  in February 1883. On its maiden voyage, it carried 3,842 tons of cargo, including  railway track  for the Victorian Government, liquor, chemicals, drapery, and dynamite. It reached Australia in July, but got caught on the reef at  Point Lonsdale  while being towed into  Port Melbourne . The ship sat there for nearly two months before breaking up and sinking on 26 August 1883. The wreck remains under 4–5 metres of water and is accessible to recreational divers. This photograph by the German-born photographer  Fred Kruger  shows  George Roper 's  wreck at Point Lonsdale before it sank.
