>Fumarole minerals  are minerals that are deposited by  fumarole  exhalations. They form when gases and compounds desublimate or precipitate out of condensates, forming mineral deposits. They are mostly associated with volcanoes (as volcanic sublimate or fumarolic sublimate), following  deposition  from volcanic gas during an eruption or discharge from a volcanic vent or fumarole, but have been encountered on  burning coal deposits  as well. They can be black or multicoloured and are often unstable upon exposure to the atmosphere. This fumarole formation, formed of  acicular  crystals of tazieffite (black), was photographed at  Mutnovsky , a volcano on the  Kamchatka Peninsula  in Russia.
