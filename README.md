>Ruth Handler  (November 4, 1916 – April 27, 2002) was an American businesswoman who created the fashion doll  Barbie  in 1959. With her husband  Elliot Handler , she co-founded the toy manufacturer  Mattel  in 1945 and served as its first president for thirty years. Handler got the idea for Barbie from German  Bild Lilli dolls , which were based on the West German comic strip  Lilli . Handler noticed that her daughter Barbara enjoyed giving toys adult roles; at the time, most children's dolls were infants. Handler designed the new doll with the help of  Jack Ryan  and named the doll "Barbie" after her daughter. She also later designed the doll  Ken , which she named after her son. This photograph taken in 1961 depicts Handler with Barbie and Ken dolls, as well as other Mattel products.
