>The Duchess of Dantzic  is a  comic opera  in three acts, set in  Paris , with music by  Ivan Caryll  and a book and lyrics by  Henry Hamilton , based on the play  Madame Sans-Gêne  by  Victorien Sardou  and  Émile Moreau .  Additional lyrics by  Adrian Ross .  The story concerns  Napoleon  and a laundress,  Catherine Üpscher , who marries  Marshal Lefebvre  and becomes a duchess. The opera was first produced in London at the  Lyric Theatre  in 1903 and ran for 236 performances.  Subsequently, it enjoyed a successful New York production at  Daly's Theatre  and other productions around the world, and was revived in London and performed regularly by amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, until the 1950s. This 1903 poster for the opera's original production was designed by the show's costume designer,  Percy Anderson .
