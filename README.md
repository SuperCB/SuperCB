>The  sword-billed hummingbird  ( Ensifera ensifera ) is a  neotropical  species of  hummingbird  from the Andean regions of South America. Among the largest species of hummingbird, it is characterized by its unusually long beak, being the only bird to have a beak longer than the rest of its body, excluding the tail. It uses this to drink nectar from flowers with long  corollas  and has  coevolved  with the plant  Passiflora mixta . While most hummingbirds  preen  using their beaks, the sword-billed hummingbird uses its feet to scratch and preen due to its beak being so long.
