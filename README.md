>The  National Library of Poland  is a  central library  of Poland and one of the oldest cultural institutions in the country. Established on 24 February 1928 by a decree of President  Ignacy Mościcki , it traces its origins to the  Załuski Library , one of the first  public libraries  in Europe, founded in 1747. The library's headquarters is located in the district of  Ochota  in  Warsaw , with additional facilities at the  Krasiński Palace , which houses  its collection of early printed books and manuscripts . This photograph shows an aerial view of the main complex of the National Library of Poland, designed by Stanisław Fijałkowski and built 1962–1976, surrounded by  Mokotów Field .
