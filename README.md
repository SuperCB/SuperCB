>Jasper Francis Cropsey  (1823–1900) was an American  landscape artist , part of a movement known as the  Hudson River School . Cropsey was trained as an  architect , and worked on Manhattan  brownstones , the since-demolished  14th Street station  for the  IRT Sixth Avenue Line  in Manhattan, and St. Luke's Episcopal Church on  Staten Island . In addition to architecture, Cropsey also studied  watercolor painting  and  figure drawing , exhibiting his work at the  National Academy of Design  from 1844. In 1866, he opened a studio in New York, specializing in autumnal landscape paintings of the northeastern United States, often idealized and with vivid colors. Cropsey co-founded, with ten fellow artists, the  American Society of Painters in Water Colors  in 1866. He is seen here in a circa-1870 photograph by American  lithographer  and photographer  Napoleon Sarony .
