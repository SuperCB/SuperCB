>The  Laughing Cavalier  is an  oil-on-canvas  portrait by the Dutch Golden Age painter  Frans Hals , completed in 1624. The title is an invention of the  Victorian  public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the  Bethnal Green Museum  from 1872 to 1875, just after its arrival in England. The  Laughing Cavalier  was described by art historian  Seymour Slive  as "one of the most brilliant of all Baroque portraits" and has been used in several derivative works, such as the logo of  McEwan's , in which a modified version of the cavalier is depicted enjoying a glass of the beer. The painting is now housed in the  Wallace Collection  in London.
