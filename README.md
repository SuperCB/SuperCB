>Apollo 4 , also known as SA-501, was the first, uncrewed, flight in the United States  Apollo program , and the first test of the  Saturn V  launch vehicle, the rocket that would be used to send astronauts to the Moon. The  space vehicle  was the first to be launched from  Kennedy Space Center  in Florida, lifting off from  Launch Complex 39A , where facilities designed specially for the Saturn V had been constructed, on November 9, 1967 – depicted in this photograph. The original launch date was planned for late 1966, but was delayed due to a myriad of problems with various elements of the spacecraft, and difficulties during pre-flight testing. Also contributing to the delays was the need for additional inspections following the  Apollo 1  fire that killed the first Apollo crew in January 1967. These issues delayed the flight through much of 1967. The mission splashed down in the Pacific Ocean slightly less than nine hours after launch, having achieved its objectives.
