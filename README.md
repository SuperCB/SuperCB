>De Viron Castle  is a castle in the town of  Dilbeek  in Flemish Brabant, Belgium. Commissioned by the de Viron family, which settled in Dilbeek in 1775, the castle was built in 1863 by  Jean-Pierre Cluysenaar . The  Renaissance Revival  castle was built on the ruins of a 14th-century fortification that was destroyed in 1862. One of the medieval towers, the Sint-Alenatoren, can still be seen in the park surrounding the current building and is named after  Saint Alena , who lived in Dilbeek. The castle has served as the town hall of Dilbeek and housed the offices of the municipality since 1923, and was listed as a  Belgian protected monument  in 1990. This photograph shows the facade of De Viron Castle with the surrounding park in the foreground.
