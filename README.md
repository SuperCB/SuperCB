>Joseph Bazalgette  (28 March 1819 – 15 March 1891) was an English  civil engineer . As Chief Engineer of London's  Metropolitan Board of Works , his major achievement was the creation of a  sewerage system for central London , in response to the  Great Stink  of 1858, which was instrumental in relieving the  city  of  cholera  epidemics, while beginning to clean the  River Thames . He later designed the second and current  Hammersmith Bridge , which opened in 1887. This photograph of Bazalgette was taken between 1864 and 1877.
