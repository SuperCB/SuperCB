>Ike & Tina Turner  were an American musical duo consisting of husband and wife  Ike Turner  and  Tina Turner . The duo had a string of R&B hits with their early recordings " A Fool In Love ", " It's Gonna Work Out Fine ", " I Idolize You ", " Poor Fool ", and " Tra La La La La ". The release of " River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High " in 1966, followed by a tour of the UK with  the Rolling Stones , increased their popularity in Europe. Their later works are noted for interpretive soul-infused re-arrangements of  rock  songs such as " Come Together ", " Honky Tonk Woman ", and " Proud Mary ", the latter of which won them a  Grammy Award  in 1972. Ike & Tina Turner received the first Golden European Record Award for their international hit " Nutbush City Limits " in 1974. They released dozens of albums; their most successful by chart performance being  Workin' Together .  Pitchfork  listed their album  River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High  among the best of its era. Although their partnership was successful musically, they had a tumultuous marriage. In his autobiography, Ike wrote, "Sure, I've slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her." Tina stated that "It was my relationship with Ike that made me most unhappy. At first, I had really been in love with him. Look what he'd done for me. But he was totally unpredictable." They divorced in 1976, and Tina went on to enjoy a highly successful solo career. This photograph of Ike and Tina was taken at  Schiphol Airport  in Amsterdam in 1971.
