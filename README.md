>The  City Palace of Jaipur , constructed between 1727 and 1732, is a royal residence located in  Jaipur , Rajasthan, India. It was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the  Kingdom of Amber , and home of its rulers, from the time of the state's foundation in 1727 by Maharaja  Sawai Jai Singh  II until 30 March 1949. The palace continues to be a residence of the royal family of Jaipur and is a popular tourist attraction. This picture shows the  Leheriya  gate, one of four intricately designed gates in an inner courtyard of the palace. The gate is dedicated to Hindu god  Ganesha  (carved above the door) with the green colour representing the season of spring.
