>The  Boeing  F-15EX  Eagle II  is an American  multirole  all-weather  strike fighter  manufactured by  Boeing Defense, Space & Security . Derived from the  McDonnell Douglas  F-15  Eagle  and first conceived in 2018, the  F-15EX  is not expected to survive against modern air defenses by 2028, but has the capability to perform homeland and airbase defense, enforce  no-fly zones  against limited air defenses, and deploy  standoff munitions . The aircraft made its maiden flight in February 2021, and as of 2023 has a total planned fleet size of up to 104. This  F-15EX , from the  United States Air Force 's  40th Flight Test Squadron , was photographed flying over northern California during an  aerial-refueling  operation in May 2021.
