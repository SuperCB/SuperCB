>Fomitopsis quercina  is a species of  mushroom  in the order  Polyporales . Commonly known as the oak mazegill, among other names, its  specific epithet  refers to the  oak  genus  Quercus , upon which it frequently grows, causing a  brown rot . It is found in most of Europe, following the pattern of oak distribution, and has also been reported in northern Africa, North America, Asia and Australia. The mushroom features  pores  which form a maze-like appearance.  Though inedible, it can be used as a natural comb and has been the subject of chemical research. This  F. quercina  mushroom was photographed growing on a tree branch at De Famberhorst, a nature reserve in the town of  Joure  in  Friesland , Netherlands. The photograph was  focus-stacked  from 21 separate images.
