>Lichfield Cathedral  is a  Church of England  cathedral in  Lichfield , in the English county of  Staffordshire . A cathedral was first built on the site in 700, by Bishop  Headda , to house the bones of  St Chad . The original wooden building was replaced by a  Norman  cathedral made from stone, which in turn was replaced by the present  Gothic  structure, begun in 1195. The fabric of the cathedral suffered in the  English Civil War , when it was used as a defensive structure. In the 18th century the interior was extensively remodelled, with major structural work organised by  James Wyatt ; this involved removing the high altar to make a single worship area consisting of the  choir  and  lady chapel , and adding a massive stone screen at the entrance to the choir. This photograph shows the choir of the cathedral, which was built around 1200.
