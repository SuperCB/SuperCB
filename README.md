>Mud  is a small Himalayan village in the cold desert region of  Spiti  in  Himachal Pradesh , India. In 2011, the village had a population of 213. At an altitude of 3,810 metres (12,500 ft) on the Pin River (a tributary of the Spiti River), the village is located at the base of the Parbati range that towers almost vertically 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above. Mud is notable geologically for the nearby Muth Formation, which consists of white quartz  arenite , which has a thickness of 258 to 300 metres (846 to 984 ft) and is resistant to weathering.
