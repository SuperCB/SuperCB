>The  sword-billed hummingbird  ( Ensifera ensifera ), also known as the swordbill, is a  neotropical  species of  hummingbird  from the  Andean  regions of South America. Among the largest species of hummingbird, it is characterized by its unusually long  beak , being the only bird to have a beak longer than the rest of its body, excluding the tail. It uses its bill to drink  nectar  from flowers with long  corollas , and has  coevolved  with the species  Passiflora mixta . While most hummingbirds  preen  using their bills, the sword-billed hummingbird uses its feet to scratch and preen due to its beak being so long. This sword-billed hummingbird was photographed perching on a branch at Hacienda El Bosque in  Manizales , Colombia.
