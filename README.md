>Portrait of Ambroise Vollard  is an 1899  oil-on-canvas  portrait by  Paul Cézanne  of his art dealer  Ambroise Vollard . It was bequeathed by Vollard on his death to the  Petit Palais  in Paris, where it is still housed today. Like many of his portraits, the  Portrait of Ambroise Vollard  displays the significant role of the subject in Cézanne's life, and specifically, the artist's gratitude for promoting his work and establishing his reputation as an artist.
