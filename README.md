>Charlotte Perkins Gilman  (1860–1935) was an American feminist, writer and lecturer. She grew up in poverty in  New England . After the break-up of her marriage in 1888, she moved to  Pasadena, California , where she became involved with feminist organizations and began writing poetry and short stories on feminism. This included " The Yellow Wallpaper ", which was published in  The New England Magazine  in 1892 and is the all-time bestselling title published by the  Feminist Press . Inspired by Gilman's own experience, it describes a woman who descends into madness while trapped in a room by her husband. She went on to become a lecturer, touring locations across the United States. This photographic portrait of Gilman was taken by  Charles Fletcher Lummis  in around 1900.
