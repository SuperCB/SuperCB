>Ornge  is a Canadian registered charity that provides  air ambulance  and associated ground transportation services for the province of  Ontario , under the direction of the province's  Ministry of Health . The name Ornge (pronounced  orange ) is based on the orange colour of the organization's aircraft and land ambulances. In 2012, the charity and its associated companies employed more than 400 people, including paramedics, pilots and aviation specialists. Ornge has its own aircraft and land ambulances, with 12 bases across Ontario. It also contracts some operations out to independent service providers.
