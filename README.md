>The  Apollo Lunar Module  was the  lunar lander  that was flown between  lunar orbit  and the Moon's surface during the American  Apollo program . Ten Lunar Modules were launched into space between 1968 and 1972. It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth. Incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the  two-stage  spacecraft was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the  Apollo command and service module , about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the Lunar Module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface. During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then  flew back to the command module , after which it was also discarded. This photograph, taken by  Neil Armstrong  during the  Apollo 11  mission in 1969, shows  Buzz Aldrin  removing equipment from the  Lunar Module  Eagle  on the surface of the Moon at  Tranquility Base .
