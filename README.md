>The  bearded vulture  ( Gypaetus barbatus ) is a very large  bird of prey  in the  monotypic  genus  Gypaetus . It is vernacularly known as the  Homa , a bird in Iranian mythology. The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate whose diet consists of 70 to 90 per cent bone. It lives and breeds on crags in high mountains in Iran, southern Europe, East Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Tibet, and the Caucasus. The bearded vulture population is thought to be in decline; since 2014, it has been classified as  near threatened  on the  IUCN Red List . Bearded vultures are 94 to 125 centimetres (37 to 49 inches) long, with a  wingspan  of 2.31 to 2.83 metres (7.6 to 9.3 feet). This bearded vulture was photographed carrying a piece of  carrion  in the  Alps  in Switzerland, where the species was  reintroduced  in the late 20th century after having become  locally extinct  in the early 20th century.
