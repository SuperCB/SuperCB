>Tarazona  is a town and municipality, and the capital of the comarca  Tarazona y el Moncayo  in  Aragon , Spain. It is also the seat of the  Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarazona . Located on the river  Queiles , a tributary of the  Ebro , Tarazona was an important regional centre of ancient Rome, known as Turiaso, located around 60 kilometres (37 miles) from  Bilbilis . The city later came under the rule of the  Visigoths , who called it Tirasona. This view of Tarazona was taken from the city's episcopal palace, and shows  Tarazona Cathedral  and its seminary, the Old Bullfight Arena, and the Sanctuary of the Lady of the River.
