>The  field sparrow  ( Spizella pusilla ) is a small sparrow in the family  Passerellidae . It is distributed across eastern Canada and the eastern United States, with northern populations migrating southwards to southern United States and north-eastern Mexico in the fall. The bird is about 140 mm long with a mass of about 12.5 g. Its head is grey with a rust-coloured crown, white eye-ring and pink bill. The upper parts are brown streaked with black and buff, the breast is buff, the belly is white and the tail is forked. There are two different colour morphs, one being greyer and the other more rufous. This field sparrow was photographed in  Central Park , New York City.
