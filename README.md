>Laocoön  is an  oil painting  created between 1610 and 1614 by  El Greco , a Greek painter of the  Spanish Renaissance . The painting depicts the Greek and Roman mythological story of the deaths of  Laocoön , a Trojan priest of  Poseidon , and his two sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus. Laocoön and his sons were strangled by sea serpents, a punishment sent by the gods after Laocoön attempted to warn his countrymen about the  Trojan Horse . Although inspired by the recently discovered monumental Hellenistic sculpture  Laocoön and His Sons  in Rome, El Greco's  Laocoön  is a product of  Mannerism , an artistic movement originating in Italy during the 16th century that countered the artistic ideals of the Renaissance. The painting is now in the  National Gallery of Art  in Washington, D.C.
