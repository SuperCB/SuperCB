>Ethel Smyth  (1858–1944) was an English composer and a member of the  women's suffrage  movement. Her compositions include songs, works for piano, chamber music, orchestral works, choral works and operas. Smyth's extensive body of work includes the Concerto for Violin, Horn and Orchestra, and the  Mass in D . Her opera  The Wreckers  is considered by some critics to be the "most important English opera composed during the period between  Purcell  and  Britten ". This photograph of Smyth was taken in 1922.
