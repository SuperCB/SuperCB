>Alsace–Lorraine , now known as Alsace–Moselle, is a historical region located in modern day France. It was created by the  German Empire  in 1871, after it had seized the region from France in the  Franco-Prussian War  with the  Treaty of Frankfurt  and forced France to pay an  indemnity  of five billion francs. Anger in the  French Third Republic  about the loss of the territory was one of the  contributing factors that led to World War I , and the region reverted to France in 1918 as part of the  Treaty of Versailles  and Germany's defeat in the war. This  oil-on-canvas painting , titled  The Geography Lesson  or  The Black Spot , was painted around 1887 by  Albert Bettannier . It depicts a school teacher showing pupils a map of France in which Alsace–Lorraine is coloured black, portraying French resentment of the loss of the region to Germany. The painting is in the collection of the  German Historical Museum  in Berlin.
