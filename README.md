>La Fuensanta  is a portrait painting by Spanish artist  Julio Romero de Torres  depicting Maria Teresa López González, one of his models. The painting was made in the autumn of 1929, when Torres completed another two artworks,  La Chiquita Piconera  and  Bodegas Cruz Conde . González was one of Torres's favourite models, having first sat for him at the age of fourteen. According to  Sotheby's , the work has been "proclaimed as a quintessential rendition of  Andalucian  beauty", and it was depicted for 25 years on the 100  peseta  banknote. The work was exhibited at the Ibero-American Exposition in Seville in 1930, and is now in a  private collection .
