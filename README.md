>Whitehead's trogon  ( Harpactes whiteheadi ) is a species of bird in the family  Trogonidae . It is endemic to the island of  Borneo , where it is an uncommon  resident  in  primary  mountain forest. One of Borneo's largest trogons at 29 to 33 centimetres (11 to 13 inches) long, it is  sexually dimorphic . The male is crimson on the head,  nape , and underparts, with a black throat and grey chest; the rest of its  upperparts  are cinnamon-coloured. The female is similarly patterned, but cinnamon-brown where the male is scarlet. The species is primarily an  insectivore , but also eats various plant materials, including fruits and seeds. Other than the timing of its breeding, typically between April and June, little is known about its breeding biology. It is classified as a  near-threatened species , with population numbers thought to be declining and  habitat loss  a key threat. This male Whitehead's trogon was photographed perching on a branch on  Mount Kinabalu  in the Malaysian state of  Sabah .
