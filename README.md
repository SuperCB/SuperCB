>The  hummingbird hawk-moth  ( Macroglossum stellatarum ) is a species of  hawk moth  found across temperate regions of  Eurasia , from Portugal to Japan. Its long  proboscis  (25–28 mm; 0.98–1.10 in) and its hovering behavior, accompanied by an audible humming noise, give it a resemblance to the  hummingbird . Like hummingbirds, it feeds on flowers which have tube-shaped  corollae ; this is an example of  convergent evolution . The hummingbird hawk-moth flies during the day, especially in bright sunshine, but also at dusk, dawn, and even in the rain, which is unusual for even diurnal hawk moths. It engages in free hovering flight, which allows more maneuverability and control than fixed-wing flight, despite high energetic cost. This hummingbird hawk-moth in flight was photographed near Yastrebets in  Rila , a mountain range in Bulgaria.
