>Pisaura mirabilis  is a species of arachnid in the family Pisauridae, the  nursery web spiders . It has a  palearctic  distribution, being found all over Europe, and also inhabits the  Canary Islands  and  Madeira , the Asian part of Russia, China and North Africa. It lives in all habitats but prefers wet environments, and inhabits all  strata  from the ground to the top of trees, at altitudes up to 1,100 metres (3,600 feet), but is not found under rocks or in caves. The spider has relatively long legs, the fourth pair being the longest, and a slender  opisthosoma . Males are 10 to 13 millimetres (0.39 to 0.51 in) in length, while females are 12 to 15 millimetres (0.47 to 0.59 in). This photograph shows a female  P. mirabilis  spider carrying an egg sac, photographed at a lake near  Wolvercote  in Oxfordshire, England.
