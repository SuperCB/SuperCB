>Salisbury Cathedral  is a  Church of England  cathedral in the city of  Salisbury  in  Wiltshire , England. It was built between 1220 and 1258 in  Early English Gothic style . This photograph, taken in 2014, shows the interior of Salisbury Cathedral, looking eastwards towards the  high altar  through the tall and narrow  nave . It has three levels: a tall pointed  arcade , an open gallery, and a small  clerestory . The nave includes an unconventional modern  baptismal font , installed in September 2008. Designed by the water sculptor  William Pye , it is the largest working font in any British cathedral. The font is cruciform in shape, and has a 10-foot-wide (3.0 m) vessel filled to its brim with water, designed so that the water overflows in filaments through each corner into bronze gratings embedded in the cathedral's stone floor.
