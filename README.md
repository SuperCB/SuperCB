>Vernon Jordan  (1935–2021) was an American business executive and civil rights attorney. After growing up in the  racially segregated society of the Southern United States , Jordan graduated from  DePauw University  in  Indiana  as the only black student in a class of 400. He went on to work for various organizations involved in the  civil rights movement , first as a lawyer and then as an activist, before becoming a political advisor to President  Bill Clinton  in the 1990s. This photograph shows Jordan working on a voter education program in 1967, seated at a desk with a typewriter at the offices of the  Southern Regional Council  in Atlanta.
