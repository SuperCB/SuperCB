>The  dusky grasswren  ( Amytornis purnelli ) is a species of small  passerine  bird in the family  Maluridae . The species is endemic to Australia, in which it is limited to inland areas of the  Northern Territory ,  Western Australia  and  South Australia . The dusky grasswren inhabits rocky ranges and outcrops, often preferring tumbled talus or  scree , and with areas of thick, long-unburnt spinifex grasses in the genus  Triodia . In the wild, it has been observed feeding on a range of small arthropods and other invertebrates as well as seeds. The vocal repertoire of the dusky grasswren is varied and includes trills, high-pitched whistles, rapid twittering, and high-speed warbling. This dusky grasswren was photographed in  Ormiston Pound  in the Northern Territory.
