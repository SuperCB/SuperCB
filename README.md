>Arthur Sullivan  (1842–1900) was an English composer best known for  his operatic collaborations  with the dramatist  W. S. Gilbert . Among his early works were a ballet, a symphony, a cello concerto and a one-act  comic opera ,  Cox and Box , which is still widely performed. He wrote his first opera with Gilbert,  Thespis , in 1871. The impresario  Richard D'Oyly Carte  engaged Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece,  Trial by Jury , in 1875. Its box-office success led the partners to collaborate on twelve full-length comic operas, known as the  Savoy operas , including  H.M.S. Pinafore ,  The Pirates of Penzance  and  The Mikado . Sullivan's only  grand opera ,  Ivanhoe , though initially successful in 1891, has rarely been revived. His works include twenty-four operas, eleven major orchestral works, ten choral works and  oratorios , two ballets,  incidental music  to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces. His hymns and songs include " Onward, Christian Soldiers " and " The Lost Chord ". This  carte de visite  of Sullivan was taken around 1870 by the English photographer H. J. Whitlock.
