>Earth  is the third  planet  from the  Sun  and the only  astronomical object  known to harbor  life . It is the densest planet in the  Solar System  and the largest and most massive of its four  rocky planets . About 29 percent of Earth's surface is  land , with the remaining 71 percent  covered with water  and much of  Earth's polar regions  covered in  ice . Earth's interior is active with  a solid-iron inner core ,  a liquid outer core  that generates  Earth's magnetic field , and a convective  mantle  that drives  plate tectonics . Earth formed  more than 4.5 billion years ago . Within the first billion years of  Earth's history ,  life appeared in the oceans  and began to affect  Earth's atmosphere  and surface. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, its physical properties and  its geological history  have allowed life to  evolve  and thrive, including  more than 8 billion humans  as of 2024. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the  Moon , which  orbits Earth  at a radius of 384,400 km (238,900 mi) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. This photograph of Earth straddling the lunar horizon was taken in 2015 by  NASA 's  Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter  while located 134 km (83 mi) above the crater  Compton , visible in the foreground. To capture the image, the spacecraft had to be rolled 67 degrees to its side, and slewed with the direction of travel to maximize the width of the lunar horizon, while traveling more than 1600 m/s (3600 mph) relative to the surface.
