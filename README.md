>A Sensation Novel  is a comic  musical play  in three acts (described as "volumes" in the programme), one of a series written by the dramatist  W. S. Gilbert  for the  Royal Gallery of Illustration , with music composed by  Thomas German Reed , though much of the music is lost. The play premiered on 31 January 1871 and concerns an author suffering from  writer's block  who finds that the characters in his novel are dissatisfied when they come to life and complain about their fate. The piece satirises the  sensation novels  popular as pulp detective fiction in the  Victorian era . This  lithographic  poster was designed by Robert Jacob Hamerton to advertise the premiere of  A Sensation Novel .
