>West Virginia  is a  state  in the  Southern  or  Mid-Atlantic  regions of the United States. It is the  10th-smallest state by area  and ranks as the  12th-least populous state , with a population of 1,793,716 residents. The state was formed in 1861, comprising a number of counties which separated from the state of  Virginia  after the latter had  seceded from the United States . West Virginia was admitted to the  Union  in 1863, and was a key  border state  during  the American Civil War . The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant coal mining and logging industries, and its political and labor history. It is also a popular tourist destination.  Charleston  is the capital and  most populous city  of the state. This 1876 illustration of the  Seal of West Virginia  was produced by Henry Mitchell as part of a series titled  The State Arms of the Union .
