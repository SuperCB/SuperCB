>The  radiated tortoise  ( Astrochelys radiata ) is a species of  tortoise  in the family  Testudinidae . Although it is native to and most abundant in southern Madagascar, it can also be found in the rest of this island, and has been introduced to the islands of Réunion and Mauritius. It is a very long-lived species, with recorded lifespans of up to 188 years. These tortoises are classified as  critically endangered  by the  IUCN , mainly because of the destruction of their habitat and because of poaching.
