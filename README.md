>The  Tarantula Nebula , also known as 30 Doradus, is a large  H II region  in the  Large Magellanic Cloud  (LMC). It is one of the  largest H II regions  in the  Local Group , with an estimated diameter around 650 to 1860 light years. It is around 160,000 light-years from Earth and has  apparent magnitude  of 8. The Tarantula Nebula was first observed by  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille  during an expedition to the Cape of Good Hope between 1751 and 1753. This high-resolution photograph was taken by the  Hubble Space Telescope  and shows the star-forming region of Tarantula Nebula with the  R136  super star cluster at its center.
