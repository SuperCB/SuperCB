>The  grey triggerfish  ( Balistes capriscus ) is a species of  ray-finned fish  in the  triggerfish  family, Balistidae. The species is native to shallow parts of the western Atlantic from  Nova Scotia  to Argentina and also the eastern Atlantic, the  Mediterranean Sea  and off Angola on the west coast of Africa. It is typically found over hard bottoms on reefs and rocky areas, in lagoons and in bays, at depths down to about 55 metres. It moves using undulations of its dorsal fins, and if threatened, can work its way into a protective crevice and wedge itself in place by erecting its front dorsal spine. It is difficult to dislodge from this position. The grey triggerfish is a  demersal  species and feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as shrimps, crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, sand dollars, starfish and sea cucumbers. This grey triggerfish was photographed in  Arrábida Natural Park , Setúbal District, Portugal.
