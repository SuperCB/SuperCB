>The  common starling  ( Sturnus vulgaris ) is a medium-sized  perching bird  in the starling family,  Sturnidae . It is about 20 centimetres (8 inches) long and has glossy black  plumage , which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults. It is a noisy bird, especially in communal  roosts , with an unmusical but varied song. The starling has about a dozen  subspecies  breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate Europe and western Asia, and it has been introduced elsewhere. This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations  migrate  south and west in winter. The starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, pale blue eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. The species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of  invertebrates , as well as seeds and fruit. The starling's gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the medieval Welsh  Mabinogion  and the works of  Pliny the Elder  and  William Shakespeare . This common starling was photographed at  Bodega Head  on the northern coast of the U.S. state of California.
