>Diwali  is a five-day Hindu festival of lights which symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness and good over evil. It commemorates the day when Hindu god  Rama , along with his wife-consort  Sita  and brother  Lakshmana , returned to his kingdom of  Ayodhya  after defeating demon-king  Ravana  and following 14 years of exile. Celebrations peak on the night of the third day of the festival—the main day of Diwali, which is today—marking the darkest night of the  Hindu lunisolar calendar . People celebrate on this day by lighting traditional lamps ( diyas ) and candles. Pictured here is a woman lighting candles on Diwali.
