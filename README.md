>Ulysses S. Grant  (1822–1885) was the 18th  President of the United States  (1869–77). He graduated from the  U.S. Military Academy  at  West Point  and retired after serving in the  Mexican–American War . When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the U.S. Army and won major victories at  Shiloh  and  Vicksburg , and in the  Chattanooga campaign . After promotion to  Commanding General , Grant confronted  Robert E. Lee  in a series of bloody  battles in Virginia  in 1864, trapping Lee's army in the  siege of Petersburg . Lee's surrender to Grant at  Appomattox  on April 9, 1865, ended the war. After the war, he implemented Congressional  Reconstruction . Elected president  in 1868 , Grant led the  Republicans  in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism, protect  African American  citizenship, and support economic prosperity nationwide. In foreign policy, Grant sought to increase American trade and influence, while remaining at peace with the world. His presidency has often come under criticism for tolerating corruption and, in his second term, leading the nation into an economic depression. After an unsuccessful attempt at nomination for a third term in 1880, he completed  his memoirs , garnering critical acclaim and financial success.
