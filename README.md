>SpaceX  CRS-8  was a  Commercial Resupply Services  mission to the  International Space Station  that launched on April 8, 2016, at 20:43 UTC. It was  the twenty-third flight  of a  Falcon 9  rocket, the tenth flight of a  Dragon  cargo spacecraft, and the eighth operational mission contracted to  SpaceX  by  NASA  under the Commercial Resupply Services program. After boosting the payload on its  orbital trajectory , the rocket's first stage re-entered the denser layers of the atmosphere and landed vertically on the ocean landing platform  Of Course I Still Love You  nine minutes after liftoff (as pictured in this photograph), thus achieving a long-sought-after milestone in the  SpaceX reusable launch system development program .
