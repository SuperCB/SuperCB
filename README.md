>KiMo Theater  is a theater and historic landmark located in  Albuquerque, New Mexico , on the northeast corner of  Central Avenue  and Fifth Street. It was built in 1927 in the extravagant  Pueblo Deco architecture , which is a blend of  adobe -style  Pueblo Revival  building styles (rounded corners and edges), decorative motifs from indigenous cultures, and the soaring lines and linear repetition found in American  Art Deco  architecture. The name  Kimo , meaning 'mountain lion', was suggested by  Pablo Abeita  in a competition sponsored by the  Albuquerque Journal . The theater opened on September 19, 1927, with a program including Native American dancers and singers, a performance on the newly installed $18,000  Wurlitzer  theater organ, and the comedy film  Painting the Town . According to local legend, the KiMo Theatre is haunted by the ghost of Bobby Darnall, a six-year-old boy killed in 1951 when a water heater in the theater's lobby exploded. The tale alleges that a theatrical performance of  A Christmas Carol  in 1974 was disrupted by the ghost, who was supposedly angry that the staff was ordered to remove donuts they had hung on backstage pipes to appease him.
