>The  blue-throated macaw  ( Ara glaucogularis ) is a species of  macaw   that is  endemic  to a small area of north-central Bolivia, known as the  Llanos de Moxos . Recent population and range estimates suggest that about 350 to 400 individuals remain in the wild. Its demise was brought on by nesting competition, avian predation, and a small native range, exacerbated by indigenous hunting and capture for the pet trade. Although plentiful in captivity, it is  critically endangered  in the wild and protected by trading prohibitions. In 2014, the species was designated a  natural patrimony  of Bolivia. This blue-throated macaw in flight was photographed at  Loro Parque , on the Spanish island of  Tenerife  in the  Canary Islands .
