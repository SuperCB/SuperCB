>In 1921, the  Empire of Japan  turned a Korean royal cemetery into a golf course at what is now  Hyochang Park . The tomb of  Royal Noble Consort Uibin Seong  was left directly on the course; it can be seen in the center of the picture, with a fence erected around it. Two Korean children  dressed in white  can be seen caddying for two golfers. A significant majority of players who used the course were Japanese. After the  liberation of Korea  in 1945, the park was turned into a memorial for  Korean independence activists  who resisted the  Japanese colonization of Korea .
