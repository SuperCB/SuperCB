>The  Galle Lighthouse  is an onshore  lighthouse  in  Galle , Sri Lanka. The oldest light station in the country, it is operated and maintained by the  Sri Lanka Ports Authority . The first lighthouse in the area was built by the British in 1848 using cast-iron plates, but was destroyed by fire in 1936. The current 26.5-metre-high (87 ft) concrete lighthouse was built in 1939, around 100 metres (300 ft) from the original. This photograph of the Galle Lighthouse was taken in January 2020.
