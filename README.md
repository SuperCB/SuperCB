>The  gatekeeper  ( Pyronia tithonus ) is a species of butterfly in the family  Nymphalidae . Found across Europe, it is typically orange with two large brown spots on its wings and a brown pattern on the edge of its wings, although a large number of aberrant forms are known. The eyespots on the fore wings most likely reduce bird attacks; the gatekeeper is therefore often seen resting with its wings open. Colonies vary in size depending on the available habitat, and can range from a few dozen to several thousand butterflies. This male gatekeeper was photographed in  Bernwood Forest  in Buckinghamshire, England. The photograph was  focus-stacked  from 15 separate images.
