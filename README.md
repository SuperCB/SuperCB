>Machado de Assis   (1839–1908) was a Brazilian novelist, poet, playwright and short-story writer, widely regarded as the greatest writer of  Brazilian literature . In 1897, he founded and became the first president of the  Brazilian Academy of Letters . He was  multilingual , having taught himself  French ,  English ,  German  and  Greek  later in life. Machado's work shaped the realist movement in Brazil and the birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time. Generally considered to be Machado's greatest works are  Dom Casmurro  (1899),  Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas  ( Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas , also translated as  Epitaph of a Small Winner ) and  Quincas Borba  (also known in English as  Philosopher or Dog? ). In 1893, he published "A Missa do Galo" ("Midnight Mass"), often considered to be the greatest short story in Brazilian literature. This photograph of Machado was taken by the Brazilian photographer  Marc Ferrez  in 1890.
