>Blue Horse I  is an  oil-on-canvas  by  Franz Marc  executed in 1911. The first draft, produced earlier that year, was a pencil drawing which Marc drew in his sketchbook; this was about the size of a postcard and entitled Young Horse in Mountain Landscape, which already shows the composition of the later painting. The painting was part of several exhibitions that Marc and Russian painter  Wassily Kandinsky  presented to the public under the name  Der Blaue Reiter  from late 1911 until 1914.  Blue Horse I  is regarded as one of the painter's most famous paintings and is now part of the collection of the  Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus  in Munich, Germany.
