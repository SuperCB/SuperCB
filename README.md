>The  black-crowned barwing  ( Actinodura sodangorum ) is a non-migratory bird from  Mainland Southeast Asia  in the family Leiothrichidae, the  laughingthrushes . The species's first sighting was reported in April 1996 at  Ngọc Linh , Vietnam, and it was  formally described  in 1999. The black-crowned barwing is the only bird in the genus  Actinodura  to have a black crown. It has transverse barring on the wings (wingbars) and a crest, which are characteristic of the genus. Its natural  habitats  are subtropical or tropical moist  montane forest , high-altitude  shrubland , high-altitude  grassland , and  plantations . This black-crowned barwing was photographed in the Ngọc Linh Nature Reserve, Vietnam.
