>The  Mauritius kestrel  ( Falco punctatus ) is a  bird of prey  in the family  Falconidae  endemic to the forests of Mauritius, where it is restricted to the southwestern  plateau 's forests, cliffs, and ravines. It colonized the island and evolved into a distinct species from other  Indian Ocean kestrels , probably during the  Gelasian  or  Early Pleistocene  periods. The Mauritius kestrel can reach a size between 26 and 30.5 centimetres (10.2 and 12.0 inches), with a mass of up to 250 grams (8.8 ounces) and rounded wings with a span of approximately 45 centimetres (18 inches). Males are slightly smaller than the females. It is a carnivorous bird, eating geckos, dragonflies, cicadas, cockroaches, crickets, and small birds. It hunts by means of short, swift flights through the forests. In 2022, it was proclaimed the  Mauritian national bird  to mark the 30th anniversary of the Republic of Mauritius. This Mauritius kestrel was photographed in the  Ebony Forest  near the village of  Chamarel .
