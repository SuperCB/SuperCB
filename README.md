>St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate , is a  parish church of the Church of England  in the district of  Marylebone  in London. The church was consecrated in 1903, but the parish was founded in 1866. It is dedicated to  Saint Cyprian , a third-century  martyr  and  bishop  of  Carthage , and is located near the  Clarence Gate Gardens  entrance to  Regent's Park , off  Baker Street . The parish was formed by the efforts of the noted "slum priest" Charles Gutch, who wanted a church of his own in London.  Gutch negotiated for a small portion of the parish of  St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge , to be transferred to a new mission district where church attendance was in any case poor. The district was about one-tenth the area of the parish, but it was densely populated due to the overcrowded slums that at that time occupied much of it. This photograph depicts the  rood screen  of St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate, designed by  Ninian Comper  in the  Gothic Revival  style along with the rest of the church.
