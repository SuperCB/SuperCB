>The  Adoration of the Shepherds  is an episode in the story of the  Nativity of Jesus  in which  shepherds  are near witnesses to  Jesus 's birth in  Bethlehem . It is based on the account in the  Gospel of Luke  and follows the  Annunciation to the Shepherds , in which the shepherds are summoned by an angel to the scene of the birth. Like the episode preceding it, the Adoration of the Shepherds is  a common subject in art , where it is often combined with the  Adoration of the Magi . Depictions of the shepherds' adoration of the  Christ Child  as a subject distinct from that of the  biblical Magi  began to appear around the 15th century in artworks and  altarpieces  in the  western Christian world . The shepherds are sometimes shown presenting simpler gifts than those of the Magi, such as lambs. This  Adoration of the Shepherds  is an oil-on-canvas painting by  Bartolomé Esteban Murillo , a Spanish  Baroque artist . Painted around 1650, the work is now in the  Museo del Prado  in  Madrid .
