>InSight  was an American spacecraft mission launched by  NASA  and the  Jet Propulsion Laboratory , consisting of a robotic  lander  designed to study the deep interior of the planet  Mars . Launched in 2018, the mission was active until late 2022, when contact with the lander was lost.  InSight 's  objectives were to place a  seismometer  on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate three-dimensional models of the planet's interior, and to measure internal  heat transfer  using a heat probe to study Mars's early geological evolution. This was intended to provide a new understanding of how the Solar System's  terrestrial planets  (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) as well as the Moon formed and evolved. This 2015 photograph shows three technicians working on the  InSight  lander with its  solar panels  deployed during preflight testing in a  cleanroom  in  Denver , Colorado.
