>Walnuts  are edible seeds taken from trees in the genus  Juglans . The three species most commonly grown for their seeds are  J. regia , originating from Iran, from which the Persian (or English) walnut is harvested;  J. nigra , the black walnut tree, native to eastern North America; and  J. ailantifolia , the Japanese walnut, also known as the heartnut. Numerous walnut  cultivars  have been developed commercially, nearly all of which are hybrids of the English walnut. They are often eaten as a snack, and can also be added to cooked meals, cereals and bread.
