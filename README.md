>Princess Ida  is a  comic opera  with music by  Arthur Sullivan  and a  libretto  by  W. S. Gilbert . It was  Gilbert and Sullivan 's eighth operatic collaboration, preceding  The Mikado .  Princess Ida  opened at the  Savoy Theatre  in 1884 and ran for 246 performances. Based on the narrative poem  The Princess  by  Alfred, Lord Tennyson , the opera concerns a princess who founds a women's university and teaches that women are superior to men and should rule in their stead. Prince Hilarion, to whom she had been betrothed, sneaks into the university, and a war erupts between the two sexes.  Princess Ida  satirizes feminism, women's education and Darwinian evolution, controversial topics in conservative  Victorian England .  Princess Ida  was only a modest success, and after its initial run, it was not revived in London until 1919. Nevertheless, the piece is performed regularly today by both professional and amateur companies. This watercolour-and-pencil-on-card image by  C. Wilhelm  shows his costume design for the characters of Arac, Guron and Scynthius in the 1884 production of  Princess Ida .
