>Caroline Hill  (1845 – unknown) was an English actress. She began acting as a child in the company of  Samuel Phelps  and soon joined the company of  J. B. Buckstone  at the  Haymarket Theatre . There she created roles in several new plays, including some by  W. S. Gilbert , in whose plays she continued to act later in her career. She played at various London and provincial theatres in the 1870s. In 1883, Hill married the actor  Herbert Kelcey , with whom she had begun to appear on stage. The couple played mostly in New York City in the 1880s, and Hill continued to act through the 1890s, mostly in England.
