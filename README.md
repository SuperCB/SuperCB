>Tribhuvan  (1906–1955) was  King of Nepal  from 11 December 1911 until his death. Born in the Nepalese capital,  Kathmandu , he ascended to the throne at the age of five, upon the death of his father  Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah , and was crowned in 1913 with his mother acting as  regent . At the time of his crowning, the position of monarch was largely ceremonial, with the real governing power residing with the  Rana dynasty . During  World War I , the Ranas wanted Nepal to join the war in support of the United Kingdom, while the royal family wished to remain neutral. Eventually, Prime Minister  Chandra Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana  pressured the young king while threatening his mother, forcing him to order the troops to war. This photograph, held by  Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya , was taken at Tribhuvan's coronation in 1911.
