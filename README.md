>Chromolithography  is a method of  printmaking  using multiple colours, stemming from the process of  lithography . It became the most successful of several methods of  colour printing  developed by the 19th century. This image is a chromolithograph of  Love or Duty  by  Gabriele Castagnola , printed by Hangard-Mangué of Paris. The blocks on the lower right-hand side show the nineteen colours of ink used. The image depicts, like many of Castagnola's works,  Lucrezia Buti  and  Filippo Lippi . Lippi, a painter, was in 1458 working in the city of  Prato , Italy, where he set about painting a picture for the monastery chapel of Saint Margherita in that city. There he met Lucrezia, a beautiful  novice  of the order. Lippi asked that she  model  for the figure of the  Virgin Mary , or perhaps  Margaret the Virgin . The two began a sexual relationship, and Buti moved into Lippi's home. This relationship resulted in a son,  Filippino Lippi , who became a famous painter, and a daughter, Alessandra.
