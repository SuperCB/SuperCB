>David Livingstone  (19 March 1813 – 1 May 1873) was a Scottish physician,  Congregationalist , pioneer Christian  missionary  with the  London Missionary Society , and an  explorer  in Africa. Livingstone was married to  Mary Moffat Livingstone , from the prominent 18th-century Moffat missionary family. His fame as an explorer and his obsession with learning the sources of the  Nile  was founded on the belief that if he could solve that age-old mystery, his fame would give him the influence to end the  East African Arab–Swahili slave trade . Livingstone's subsequent exploration of the central African watershed was the culmination of the classic period of European geographical  discovery and colonial penetration of Africa . His missionary travels, "disappearance", and eventual death in Africa‍—‌and subsequent glorification as a posthumous national hero in 1874‍—‌led to the founding of several major central African Christian missionary initiatives carried forward in the era of the European " Scramble for Africa ". This portrait by  Thomas Annan  was taken in 1864.
