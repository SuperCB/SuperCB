>The  garden strawberry  ( Fragaria × ananassa ) is a widely grown  hybrid  plant cultivated worldwide for its  fruit . The genus  Fragaria , the strawberries, is in the rose family,  Rosaceae . The fruit is appreciated for its aroma, bright red colour, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is eaten either fresh or in prepared foods such as  jam ,  ice cream , and  chocolates . Artificial strawberry flavourings and aromas are widely used in commercial products. Botanically, the strawberry is not a  berry , but an  aggregate   accessory  fruit. Each apparent 'seed' on the outside of the strawberry is actually an  achene , a botanical fruit with a seed inside it. The garden strawberry was first bred in  Brittany , France, in the 1750s via a cross of  F. virginiana  from eastern North America and  F. chiloensis , which was brought from Chile by  Amédée-François Frézier  in 1714.  Cultivars  of  F.  ×  ananassa  have replaced the woodland strawberry  F. vesca  in commercial production. In 2023, world production of strawberries exceeded ten million tons, led by China with 40% of the total. These  focus-stacked  photographs show two garden strawberries, one whole and one halved.
