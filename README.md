>The  Extremely Large Telescope  (ELT) is an  astronomical observatory  under construction. Part of the  European Southern Observatory  (ESO) agency, it is located on top of  Cerro Armazones  in the  Atacama Desert  of northern Chile. The project was proposed in 2011 with construction beginning in 2017. Completion and  first light  is anticipated to take place in 2028. The ELT's design consists of a reflecting telescope with a 39.3-metre-diameter (130-foot) segmented primary mirror and a 4.2 m (14 ft) diameter secondary mirror. When completed, it will be the world's largest  optical telescope . This picture shows a schematic view of the ELT, released by the ESO in 2012.
