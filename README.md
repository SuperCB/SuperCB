>Golden Delicious  is a  cultivar  of  apple . The cultivar arose from a  chance seedling , possibly a hybrid of  Grimes Golden  and  Golden Reinette . The original tree was found on the family farm of J. M. Mullins in  Clay County, West Virginia , and was locally known as Mullins' Yellow Seedling. Mullins sold the tree and propagation rights to  Stark Brothers Nurseries and Orchards  for $5000, which first marketed it as a companion of their  Red Delicious  in 1914 (although the two cultivars are not closely related). Golden Delicious is one of the most popular apple cultivars in the United States, popular for eating as well as in  salads ,  apple sauces , and  apple pies . This photograph of one whole and one halved Golden Delicious apple was  focus-stacked  from six images.
