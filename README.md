>Nathan Francis Mossell  (July 27, 1856 – October 27, 1946) was an American physician. Born in  Hamilton, Ontario , Mossell was the fourth of six children and both his parents were descended from freed slaves. During the  American Civil War , the family moved back to the United States, settling in  Lockport, New York , where Mossell's father went into business. Mossell earned a degree from  Lincoln University , a historically black college in Pennsylvania, followed by the  University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , where he graduated in 1882. He was active in the  NAACP  and also helped found the  Douglass Hospital  in West Philadelphia in 1895, which he led as chief of staff and medical director until he retired in 1933. His wife was the activist and teacher  Gertrude Bustill Mossell . This portrait of Mossell was taken around 1882.
