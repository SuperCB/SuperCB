>Bell Island  is a small island in the  Barents Sea , south-west of the  Franz Josef Land  archipelago in  Arkhangelsk Oblast , Russia. The island was named by the English explorer  Benjamin Leigh Smith  for its bell-shaped mountain which rises steeply from the island's southern coast. The island was the first among the Franz Josef archipelago to be visited by Leigh Smith in an expedition he undertook in 1880. In a second expedition to the islands in 1881, Leigh Smith built the wooden Eira lodge on the north side of the island which he used to winter. The lodge stands to this day. The island was later visited by the  Svyataya Anna  of the ill-fated  Brusilov expedition  in 1914. This view shows Bell Island in 2017 with Eira lodge in the foreground.
