>Presidents' Day , officially known as Washington's Birthday at the federal governmental level, is a holiday in the United States celebrated on the third Monday in February. It is often celebrated to honor all those who served as  presidents of the United States  and, since 1879, has been the  federal holiday  honoring  Founding Father   George Washington , who led the  Continental Army  to victory in the  American Revolutionary War , presided at the  Constitutional Convention  of 1787, and was the first  United States president . The portrait of Washington shown here was one of 130 copies that the American painter  Gilbert Stuart  made of his unfinished  Athenaeum Portrait , which is Stuart's most notable work and the basis for the  engraving  of Washington on the  United States one-dollar bill . This copy is in the collection of the  Clark Art Institute  in  Williamstown, Massachusetts .
