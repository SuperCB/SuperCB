>Mount Api  is a  limestone  mountain located in  Gunung Mulu National Park  in  Sarawak , Malaysia. It is part of the same formation as  Mount Benarat  and Mount Buda. Mount Api is notable for its striking limestone  karst  formations, commonly known as "the pinnacles". The mountain hosts many  caves , with passages linking to the massive  Clearwater Cave system . It features a great diversity of  pitcher plants , with at least eight different species recorded on the mountain. This 2019 photograph shows the karst pinnacles near the peak of Mount Api.
