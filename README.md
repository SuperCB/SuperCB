>Platycypha caligata , commonly known as the dancing jewel, is a species of  damselfly  in the family  Chlorocyphidae . It is found in eastern, central and southern Africa from Ethiopia to Angola and South Africa.  Its natural habitats include shady parts of subtropical or tropical streams and rivers in forest, woodland, savanna, shrubland, and the shorelines of lakes. Males perform remarkable  territorial  and  courtship displays  which include flashing their brightly coloured legs with flattened tibiae and waving their abdomens. This male dancing jewel, with a length of around 35 mm, was photographed near  Victoria Falls  in Zambia.
