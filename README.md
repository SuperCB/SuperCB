>The  platypus  ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including  Tasmania . It is the sole living representative of the family  Ornithorhynchidae  and, together with the four species of  echidna , it is one of the five extant species of  monotreme  – mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Like other monotremes, the platypus senses prey in cloudy water through  electrolocation . The male platypus has a  spur  on the hind foot that delivers  an extremely painful venom , making it one of the few species of venomous mammals. This platypus was photographed swimming in a creek near  Scottsdale  in Tasmania.
