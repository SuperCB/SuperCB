>The  14th Dalai Lama  (born 6 July 1935), also known by the spiritual name  Tenzin Gyatso , is the incumbent  Dalai Lama , the highest spiritual leader and head of  Tibetan Buddhism . He served as the resident spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet before the  1959 Tibetan uprising  against the  Chinese annexation of Tibet , when he escaped from Tibet to India. Subsequently, he led the Tibetan  government-in-exile , represented by the  Central Tibetan Administration  in  Dharamshala , India. A belief central to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, as well as the institution of the Dalai Lama, is that he is a living  bodhisattva , specifically an emanation of  Avalokiteśvara  (in Sanskrit) or Chenrezig (in Tibetan), the Bodhisattva of Compassion. This photograph of the Dalai Lama was taken in 2012.
