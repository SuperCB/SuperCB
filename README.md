>Kobe Bryant  (1978–2020) was an American professional  basketball  player who spent his entire twenty-year career with the  Los Angeles Lakers  in the  National Basketball Association  (NBA) as a  shooting guard . Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, Bryant won five  NBA championships  and was an eighteen-time  NBA All-Star , a fifteen-time member of the  All-NBA Team , the 2008  NBA Most Valuable Player  (MVP), and a two-time  NBA Finals MVP . He was posthumously voted into the  Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame  in 2020, and August 24 of that year was commemorated as  Kobe Bryant Day  in recognition of his jersey numbers, 8 and 24. This photograph depicts Bryant playing for the Lakers against the  Golden State Warriors  in 2005.
