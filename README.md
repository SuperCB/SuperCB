>The  flame robin  ( Petroica phoenicea ) is a small  passerine  bird native to Australia. It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including  Tasmania . It was first described by the French naturalists  Jean René Constant Quoy  and  Joseph Paul Gaimard  in 1830 and, like many brightly coloured  Australasian robins , it is  sexually dimorphic . Measuring 12 to 14 cm (5 to 6 in) long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. It mostly breeds in and around the  Great Dividing Range , the Tasmanian highlands and islands in  Bass Strait . With the coming of cooler autumn weather, most birds disperse to lower and warmer areas. This male flame robin was photographed in  Jenolan Caves , New South Wales, Australia.
