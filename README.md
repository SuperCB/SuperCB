>Katharine Hepburn  (1907–2003) was an American actress of film, stage, and television. Known for her headstrong independence and spirited personality, Hepburn's career as a  Hollywood  leading lady spanned more than 60 years. She won a record four  Academy Awards , and in 1999  was named as Hollywood's top female legend  by the  American Film Institute . Hepburn began acting in college, and spent four years in the theatre before entering films in 1932. She became an instant star, but after a series of unsuccessful films was named "box office poison".  The Philadelphia Story  revived her career, and she subsequently formed a popular alliance with  Spencer Tracy  that lasted 25 years. In middle age, Hepburn found a niche playing spinsters, such as in  The African Queen , and became a  Shakespearean  stage actress. She continued to work into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. Hepburn is remembered as an important cultural figure, as she came to epitomize the "modern woman" in 20th-century America and helped change perceptions of women. This publicity photograph of Hepburn was taken around 1941.
