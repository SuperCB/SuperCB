>Bengali cuisine  is the culinary style of  Bengal , a region encompassing Bangladesh and the Indian states of  West Bengal  and  Tripura , as well as the  Barak Valley  in  Assam . The cuisine is known for its varied use of flavours including  mustard oil , as well as its desserts. There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple, with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are preferred to seafish, although  barramundi , known as  bhetki , is also common. Although less popular than fish, Bengalis have eaten a variety of meats since pre-colonial times, ranging from pigs and deer to hedgehogs and turtles. In more recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of the diet. This photograph shows a serving of  pabda jhaal , a type of Bengali fish curry.
