>Slime mold  is an informal name given to a  polyphyletic  assemblage of unrelated  eukaryotic  organisms in the  clades   Stramenopiles ,  Rhizaria ,  Discoba ,  Amoebozoa  and  Holomycota . Most are near-microscopic; those in  Myxogastria  form larger  plasmodial  slime molds that are visible to the naked eye. Most slime molds are terrestrial and free-living, typically in damp shady habitats such as in or on the surface of rotting wood. Some myxogastrians and  protostelians  are aquatic or semi-aquatic. The  phytomyxea  are parasitic, living inside their plant  hosts . Geographically, slime molds are  cosmopolitan  in distribution. A small number of species occur in regions as dry as the  Atacama Desert  and as cold as the Arctic; they are abundant in the tropics, especially in  rainforests . This picture shows a group of  sporangia  of the slime mold  Comatricha nigra , photographed in a garden in Berlin, Germany.
