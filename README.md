>Lake Estancia  was a  prehistoric body of water  in the  Estancia Valley , in the center of the U.S. state of  New Mexico . Mostly fed by creek and  groundwater  from the  Manzano Mountains , the lake had diverse fauna, including  cutthroat trout . It appears to have formed when a river system broke up. It reached a maximum water level (highstand) presumably during the  Illinoian  glaciation and subsequently fluctuated between a desiccated basin and fuller stages. Wind-driven erosion has excavated depressions in the former lakebed that are in part filled with  playas  (dry lake beds). The lake was one of several  pluvial lakes  in southwestern North America that developed during the late  Pleistocene . Their formation has been variously attributed to decreased temperatures during the  ice age  and increased precipitation; a shutdown of the  thermohaline circulation  and the  Laurentide Ice Sheet  altered atmospheric circulation patterns and increased precipitation in the region. The lake has yielded a good  paleoclimatic  record. This map shows the shoreline of Lake Estancia at three different periods: early Estancia (1,939 m / 6,362 ft above sea level), late Estancia (1,897 m / 6,224 ft), and "Lake Willard" (1,870 m / 6,135 ft). Present-day populated places, county boundaries and roads are overlaid on the map for identification.
