>The  southern scrub robin  ( Drymodes brunneopygia ) is a species of bird in the family Petroicidae, the  Australasian robins . It is  endemic  to Australia, where it occurs in  mallee  and  heathland  in the semi-arid southern parts of the continent. Its range includes several disjoint regions from central  New South Wales  through western  Victoria  and southern  South Australia , through to the southwestern area of  Western Australia . It is a relatively dull and large robin, with adults around 19 to 20 centimetres (7.5 to 7.9 in) in length, of which around a third are the tail feathers. Most of the plumage is grey. It breeds between July and December and has a nest on the ground, built of twigs and lined with twigs, grass and bark. Unusually for a  passerine , it lays only a single egg. This southern scrub robin was photographed in the  Nombinnie Nature Reserve  in New South Wales.
