>The  white-headed pigeon   ( Columba leucomela ) is a species of pigeon native to the east coast of Australia, belonging to the same  genus  as the  common pigeon . It builds a  nest  generally consisting of scanty twigs, usually placed high in the  canopy  up to 18 metres (59 ft) above the ground, and tends to lay one cream-white egg. Breeding takes place mostly from October to December. The species is often found alone, in pairs or in small flocks. They are very quiet and elusive, and their flight is swift and direct. Its  call  is loud and gruff, sounding like a  whoo  followed by a gruff inhalation like  uk  (repeated three times). Sometimes the call is a low  oom . This male white-headed pigeon was photographed near  Brunkerville  in New South Wales.
