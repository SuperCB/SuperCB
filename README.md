>Georgians  are an ethnic group native to  Georgia  and the  Caucasus , with diaspora communities throughout Russia, Turkey, Greece, Iran, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union. Georgians arose from  Colchian  and  Iberian  civilizations of classical antiquity. In the early 4th century, the  Georgians became one of the first to embrace Christianity  and now the majority of Georgians are  Orthodox Christians . The Georgian nation was formed out of a diverse set of geographic subgroups, each with its characteristic traditions, manners,  dialects  and, in the case of the  Svans  and  Mingrelians , regional languages. The  Georgian language , with its  own unique writing system  and extensive written tradition, which goes back to the 5th century, is the  official language  of Georgia. According to the  State Ministry on Diaspora Issues of Georgia , unofficial statistics say that there are more than five million Georgians across the world. This photograph, taken around 1888 in  Mestia , shows an elderly Svan peasant with a dagger and smoking a long pipe. The image is in the collection of the  Library of Congress  in the United States.
