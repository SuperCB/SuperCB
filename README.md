>The  Allies of World War II , formally known as the United Nations from 1942, were an international military coalition formed to oppose the  Axis powers . Its principal members were the " Big Four ": the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. The Allies became a formalized group upon the  Declaration by United Nations  on 1 January 1942, which was signed by 26 countries around the world; these ranged from  governments in exile  from Axis occupation to small states far removed from the war. This became the groundwork for the present-day  United Nations , established in the  aftermath of World War II . This 1943 propaganda poster, designed by Leslie Ragan and distributed by the  United States Office of War Information , depicts the flags of many of the members of the Allies waving amidst smoke, with tanks, battleships and aircraft in the foreground. In white  all-caps  letters, the poster bears the word "United" at the top of the poster, and the caption "The United Nations Fight for Freedom" at the bottom.
