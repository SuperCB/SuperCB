>Igor Stravinsky  (17 June 1882 – 6 April 1971) was a Russian composer and conductor, considered to be one of the most important and influential  composers of the 20th century . He studied under  Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov  until the latter's death in 1908. Soon after, Stravinsky met the  impresario   Sergei Diaghilev , who commissioned the composer to write three ballets for  Ballets Russes :  The Firebird  (1910),  Petrushka  (1911), and  The Rite of Spring  (1913), the last of which  caused a near-riot at its premiere  in Paris. His compositional style varied greatly, being influenced at different times by  Russian folklore ,  neoclassicism , and  serialism . His ideas influenced  Aaron Copland ,  Philip Glass ,  Béla Bartók , and  Pierre Boulez , who were all challenged to innovate beyond traditional  tonality , rhythm, and  form . This photograph of Stravinsky in the early 1920s is from the collection of the American photojournalist  George Grantham Bain .
