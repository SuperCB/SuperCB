>Thomas Jefferson  (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, planter, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and  Founding Father  who served as the third  president of the United States  from 1801 to 1809. He was the primary author of the  Declaration of Independence . Following the  American Revolutionary War  and before becoming president in 1801, Jefferson was the first  United States secretary of state  under  George Washington , and then the second  vice president  under  John Adams . Jefferson was a leading proponent of democracy,  republicanism , and  natural rights , and he produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels. This  line-engraved  portrait of Jefferson was produced by the  United States Department of the Treasury 's  Bureau of Engraving and Printing  (BEP) as part of a  BEP presentation album  of the first 26 presidents. The same portrait appears on the obverse of the  two-dollar bill .
