>Galena , also called lead glance, is the natural mineral form of  lead(II) sulfide  (PbS). In addition to lead, some deposits contain up to 0.5 percent silver, in the form of  silver sulfide  or as limited silver in  solid solution ; when present, this byproduct far surpasses the main lead ore in revenue. Galena has been used since antiquity, one of its oldest uses being the production of  kohl , an eye cosmetic now regarded as toxic due to the risk of  lead poisoning . In modern times, galena is primarily used to extract its constituent minerals. In addition to silver, it is the most important global source of lead, for uses such as in  lead-acid batteries . This sample of galena, measuring 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.0 cm (1.38 in × 0.98 in × 0.79 in), contains a small amount of gold-colored  pyrite  and was extracted from the Huanzala Mine in the Peruvian region of  Ancash . This photograph was  focus-stacked  from 156 separate images.
