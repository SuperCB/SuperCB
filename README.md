>The  Very Large Telescope  (VLT) is an astronomical facility operated by the  European Southern Observatory , located on  Cerro Paranal  in the  Atacama Desert  of northern Chile. It consists of four individual  optical telescopes , each equipped with a  primary mirror  measuring 8.2 metres (27 feet) in diameter, which are generally used separately but can be combined to achieve a very high  angular resolution . The VLT array is complemented by four movable auxiliary telescopes with 1.8-metre (5.9-feet)  apertures , and the VLT Survey Telescope (at right in the photograph). This photograph, taken at sunset in 2015, shows the VLT and its associated telescopes and supporting buildings.
