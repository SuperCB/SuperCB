>The  Ugandan kob  ( Kobus kob thomasi ) is a  subspecies  of the  kob , a type of  antelope . It is found in  sub-Saharan Africa , in South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ugandan kob is distinguished from other kob subspecies by its reddish-brown colour. It is similar in appearance to the  impala  but is more sturdily built. Only the males have horns, which are lyre-shaped, strongly ridged and divergent. Males are slightly larger than females, being 90 to 100 centimetres (3.0 to 3.3 ft) at the shoulder, with an average weight of 94 kilograms (207 lb), while females are 82 to 92 centimetres (2.7 to 3.0 ft) at the shoulder and on average weigh about 63 kilograms (139 lb). This photograph shows two Ugandan kobs mating in  Queen Elizabeth National Park , Uganda.
