>C/2022 E3 (ZTF)  is a long-period comet from the  Oort cloud  that was discovered by the  Zwicky Transient Facility  in March 2022. The comet has a bright green glow around its nucleus, due to the effect of sunlight on  diatomic carbon  and  cyanogen . Its  comet nucleus  is estimated to be about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) in size, rotating every 8.5 to 8.7 hours. Its tails of dust and gas extended for millions of kilometres and, during January 2023, an  anti-tail  was also visible. The comet reached  perihelion  on 12 January 2023, at a distance of 1.11  AU  (166 million km; 103 million mi), and its closest approach to Earth was on 1 February 2023, at a distance of 0.28 AU (42 million km; 26 million mi). The comet reached  magnitude  5 during this approach, and was visible with the  naked eye  under moonless  dark skies . This photograph of C/2022 E3 (ZTF), released by the Italian  National Institute for Astrophysics , was taken on 27 January 2023.
