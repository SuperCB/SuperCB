>The  papaya  ( Carica papaya ), also known as the pawpaw, is a plant species in the family  Caricaceae , and also the name of the plant's fruit. It was first domesticated in  Mesoamerica , within modern-day southern Mexico and Central America, and is now grown in several countries in regions with a tropical climate. The papaya fruit is a large berry about 15 to 45 cm (5.9 to 17.7 in) long and 10 to 30 cm (3.9 to 11.8 in) in diameter. The fruit is cultivated for food, being typically consumed when ripe and eaten raw without skin or seeds. The black seeds are also edible and have a sharp, spicy taste. This photograph shows the longitudinal cross section of a papaya fruit lying on its side, with orange flesh and numerous black seeds visible. The picture was  focus-stacked  from seven separate images.
