>Carmen Miranda  (9 February 1909 – 5 August 1955) was a Portuguese-born Brazilian singer, dancer, and actress. Nicknamed "the Brazilian Bombshell", she was known for her signature  fruit hat  outfit that she wore in her American films. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941, Miranda was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of  Grauman's Chinese Theatre , and was the first South American honored with a star on the  Hollywood Walk of Fame . She died in  Beverly Hills, California , and is buried at the  Cemitério de São João Batista  in  Rio de Janeiro . This photograph depicts Miranda in a scene from the 1941 film  Week-End in Havana .
