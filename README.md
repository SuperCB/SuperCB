>Södermanland Runic Inscription 113  is a 10th-century  runic inscription  engraved on a 0.9 m by 0.5 m (35 in by 20 in) granite  runestone  in  Södermanland , Sweden. The runestone was found in 1856 on a hill believed to have once had many other graves and monuments, and is thought to have originally stood atop a burial mound before falling over and being buried. The inscription is written in  Old Norse  using the  Younger Futhark  alphabet, and reads ( transliterated  into the  Latin script ):  Þaiʀ situ stin, suniʀ Þurkitils auk Fulku, hiar faþur auk muþur iftiʀ. Kiarþu trikila , meaning: 'They placed the stone here, the sons of Þorketill and Folka, in memory of their father and mother. Made valiantly.' This photograph of the inscription was taken by  Otto von Friesen , who owned the runestone in the early 20th century.
