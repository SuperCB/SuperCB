>Nadar  (born Gaspard-Félix Tournachon; 5 April 1820 – 20 March 1910) was a French photographer,  caricaturist , journalist, novelist,  balloonist , and proponent of  heavier-than-air flight . In 1858, he became the first person to take  aerial photographs , and during the  Siege of Paris  in 1870–71, he established the first  airmail  service. In 1863, Nadar commissioned the prominent balloonist  Eugène Godard  to construct an enormous balloon, 60 metres (196 ft) high and with a capacity of 6,000 m 3  (210,000 cu ft), named  Le Géant  (The Giant). For publicity, he recreated balloon flights in his studio with his wife, Ernestine, using a rigged-up balloon gondola. This self-portrait of Nadar in a balloon basket was taken  c.  1863 .
