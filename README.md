>The  American white pelican  ( Pelecanus erythrorhynchos ) is a large aquatic soaring bird from the order  Pelecaniformes . It breeds in interior North America, moving south and to the coasts, as far as Costa Rica, in winter. Along with the  trumpeter swan , it is one of the longest birds native to North America, with an overall length of about 50 to 70 inches (130 to 180 cm). The beak measures 11.3 to 15.2 inches (290 to 390 mm) in males and 10.3 to 14.2 inches (260 to 360 mm) in females, while its wingspan is around 95 to 120 inches (240 to 300 cm). The American white pelican does not dive for its food as some other pelican species do, instead catching its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of food a day, predominantly fish, which ranges from the size of  minnows  to 3.5-pound (1.6 kg)  pickerels . This adult American white pelican in non-breeding plumage was photographed at Las Gallinas Wildlife Ponds in  San Rafael, California .
