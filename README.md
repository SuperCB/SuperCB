>Michael William Balfe  (1808–1870) was an Irish composer, best remembered for his operas. Balfe was born in  Dublin  and grew up on Pitt Street, which was renamed Balfe Street in 1917 in his honour. After moving to  Wexford  with his family as a child, he began a career as a violinist, moving to  London  in 1823 after his father's death, later relocating again to Italy and Switzerland, where he married the Hungarian-born singer Lina Roser. Balfe began pursuing an operatic singing career as well as composition, and moved back to London with his family in 1835. In a career spanning more than 40 years, he composed at least 29 operas, almost 250 songs, several  cantatas , and other works. He was also a noted conductor, directing Italian opera at  Her Majesty's Italian Opera House  for seven years, among other conducting posts. His most notable opera is  The Bohemian Girl , which continues to be performed. This photograph of Balfe was taken by the studio of the French photographer  Nadar ; this  albumen print  was made in 1900.
