>Isambard Kingdom Brunel  (1806–1859) was an English  civil  and  mechanical engineer . The son of French engineer  Marc Isambard Brunel , he worked under his father as an assistant engineer on the  Thames Tunnel  project for several years until he was seriously injured in a flooding incident. During his recuperation he began a design for a bridge in Bristol, which would later be completed as the  Clifton Suspension Bridge . In 1833, Brunel was appointed chief engineer of the  Great Western Railway , overseeing development of the main line from  London  to  Bristol  which was completed in 1841. Brunel's other achievements included the design of the first  transatlantic  steamship and dockyards. This 1857 photograph, titled  Isambard Kingdom Brunel Standing Before the Launching Chains of the Great Eastern , was taken by  Robert Howlett . It depicts Brunel standing before a drum of chain used during the launching of  SS  Great Eastern  at  Millwall  in London; he carries a cigar case, and his boots and trousers are muddy.
