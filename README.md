>Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard  (1803–1847) was a French illustrator and caricaturist who published under the pseudonym of Jean-Jacques Grandville or J. J. Grandville. He has been called "the first star of French caricature's great age", and Grandville's book illustrations described as featuring "elements of the symbolic, dreamlike, and incongruous, and they retain a sense of social commentary". The  anthropomorphic  vegetables and  zoomorphic  figures that populated his cartoons anticipated and influenced the work of generations of cartoonists and illustrators including  John Tenniel ,  Gustave Doré ,  Félicien Rops , and  Walt Disney . He has also been called a "proto-surrealist" and was greatly admired by  André Breton  and others in the  Surrealist  movement. This illustration by Grandville is plate 52 from a 1854 collection of hand-coloured  lithographs  titled  Les métamorphoses du jour  ( The Metamorphoses of the Day ), and depicts five anthropomorphic male dogs following a female dog, all dressed in human clothing. The print is captioned " Temps de canicule ", meaning 'heatwave weather' but incorporating a pun in French;  canicule  literally translates to ' dog days of summer ' and may also refer here to animals being ' in heat '.
