>The  Alc치zar of Segovia  is a medieval castle located in the city of  Segovia  in  Castile and Le칩n , Spain. Rising out on a rocky crag above the confluence of two rivers near the mountains of  Guadarrama , it is one of the most distinctive castle-palaces in Spain by virtue of its shape, resembling the  bow  of a ship. The  alc치zar  was originally built in the 11th or 12th century by the  Almoravid dynasty  as a fortress, but has since served as a royal palace where twenty-two kings reigned, a state prison, a royal artillery college, and a military academy. The castle overlooks a valley with the  Eresma River  and is a symbol of the old city of Segovia. It was declared a UNESCO  World Heritage Site  in 1985. Today, the alc치zar is used as a museum and a military archives building since its declaration as a national archive by royal decree in 1998.
