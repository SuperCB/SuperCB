>Mary Jackson  (1921–2005) was an American mathematician and  aerospace engineer  at the  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  and its successor,  NASA . She worked at  Langley Research Center  in  Hampton, Virginia , for most of her career. She started as a  computer  at the segregated  West Area Computing division  in 1951. In 1958, after taking engineering classes, she became NASA's first black female engineer. Jackson had earned the most senior engineering title available by 1979 and realized she could not earn further promotions without becoming a supervisor. She accepted a demotion to become a manager of both NASA's federal women's program and the  affirmative action  program. Her work sought to influence the career paths of women in science, engineering, and mathematics positions at NASA. Jackson is one of the leading characters in the 2016 book  Hidden Figures  and one of the three protagonists in  the book's film adaptation , released the same year. This NASA photograph of Jackson was taken in 1979.
