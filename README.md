>The  yak  ( Bos grunniens ) is a species of long-haired domesticated  cattle  in the family  Bovidae . It is found throughout the  Himalayas  in Pakistan, India, the  Tibetan Plateau  of China, Tajikistan, and as far north as Mongolia and Siberia, Russia. Yak physiology is well adapted to high altitudes and cold weather, featuring larger lungs and heart than other cattle, a greater capacity for transporting oxygen through their blood and a thick layer of  subcutaneous fat . Yaks have been domesticated in areas such as Mongolia and Tibet, primarily for  their fibre , milk and meat, and as  beasts of burden . Yaks' milk is often processed to a cheese called  chhurpi  in the Tibetan and Nepali languages, and  byaslag  in Mongolia, while  butter made from yaks' milk  is an ingredient of Tibetan  butter tea . This yak was photographed near the river  Chuya  in the  Altai Republic , a region in southern Siberia.
