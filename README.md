>Wells Cathedral  is a  Church of England  cathedral in  Wells, Somerset . Construction commenced around 1175 on the site of a late-Roman  mausoleum  and an 8th-century abbey church. The cathedral has been described by the historian  John Harvey  as Europe's first truly  Gothic  structure, lacking the  Romanesque  work that survives in many other cathedrals. It is the seat of the  bishop of Bath and Wells . This photograph depicts Wells Cathedral's organ, built from 1909 to 1910 by  Harrison & Harrison  of Durham with parts retained from the old organ that dated to the 17th century.
