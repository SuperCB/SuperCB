>Sojourner  is a robotic  Mars rover  that landed in  Ares Vallis , a channel in the  Chryse Planitia  region, on July 4, 1997.  Sojourner  was operational on Mars for 92  sols  (95 Earth days). It was the first wheeled vehicle to rove on a planet other than Earth and formed part of the  Mars Pathfinder  mission. This panoramic photograph is formed of various images of  Sojourner  taken by the  Mars Pathfinder  lander, composited into a 360-degree image referred to by NASA as the "presidential" panorama. Since the camera's position was consistent, it is possible to see these images of the rover in the context of the entire landscape.
