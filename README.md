>The  Eureka Inn  is a hotel in  Eureka, California , built in the Elizabethan  Tudor Revival  architectural style. Opened in 1922, it was purchased in 1960 by Helen Barnum, the matriarch of a successful timber family in the county, before being sold to John Biord after Barnum's death in 1993. In 2004, the inn was closed after tax defaults by its owner, reopening in 2010 after the businessman Libo Zhu purchased and refurbished it. In February 1982, the structure was listed on the  National Register of Historic Places . This photograph shows the Eureka Inn's entrance hall as seen in 2020.
