>In the Loge , also known as  At the Opera , is an 1878  impressionist  painting by the American artist  Mary Cassatt . The  oil-on-canvas  painting displays a  bourgeois  woman in a  loge  at the opera house looking through her opera glasses, while a man in the background looks at her. The woman's costume and fan make clear her upper class status. Art historians see the painting as commentary on the role of gender, looking, and power in the social spaces of the nineteenth century. The painting is currently in the collection of the  Museum of Fine Arts, Boston , which also holds a preliminary drawing for the work.
