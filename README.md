>The  violet-backed starling  ( Cinnyricinclus leucogaster ) is a relatively small species of  starling , common in most of sub-Saharan Africa. It is strongly  sexually dimorphic , with the male's iridescent violet plumage contrasting with the heavily streaked brown female. A bird of open woodland, clearings and  gallery forests , it feeds in the treetops, with its diet including fruits, seeds and insects. It nests in tree cavities, with green leaves and dung having been recorded as nesting materials. The female incubates the clutch of two to four eggs, and the male helps rear the young until they fledge about three weeks after hatching. This female violet-backed starling, of the subspecies  C. l. verreauxi , was photographed in  Damaraland , Namibia.
