>Arctocephalus forsteri , sometimes called the Australasian fur seal or the New Zealand fur seal, is a species of  fur seal  in the family Otariidae, the  eared seals . It is found mainly around southern Australia and New Zealand, in coastal waters and on offshore islands. The male of this species has an average mass of around 126 kilograms (278 lb) and a length of 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), while females are typically between 30 and 50 kilograms (66 and 110 lb), with a length of up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in).  Arctocephalus forsteri  has a deeper and longer dive than any other fur seal, with males being able to descend to 380 metres and stay underwater for 15 minutes. It has a diet which includes  cephalopods , fish, and birds, and makes use of vocalisations and  olfactory  recognition for communication. The population of the species has been significantly reduced by human activity, and it is protected by legislation in both Australia and New Zealand. This female  A. forsteri  seal with a suckling pup was photographed at Admiral's Arch on  Kangaroo Island , South Australia.
