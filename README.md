>The Beatles  were an English  rock  band formed in  Liverpool  in 1960. The core lineup of the band comprised  John Lennon ,  Paul McCartney ,  George Harrison , and  Ringo Starr .  Widely regarded as the most influential band of all time , they were integral to the development of  1960s counterculture  and the recognition of  popular music  as an art form. Rooted in  skiffle ,  beat , and 1950s  rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of  classical music  and  traditional pop  in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from  folk  and  Indian music  to  psychedelia  and  hard rock .  As pioneers in recording , songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements. This photograph shows the Beatles – from left to right, Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr – waving to a crowd of fans after arriving at  John F. Kennedy International Airport  in New York City on 7 February 1964, at the start of their first visit to the United States. Their visit marked the beginning of the  British Invasion , a cultural phenomenon of the mid-1960s when rock and pop-music acts from the United Kingdom and other aspects of British culture became popular in the United States. The band's widespread popularity and the intense reception that greeted them was termed " Beatlemania ".
