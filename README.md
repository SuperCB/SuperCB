>Aucanquilcha  is a large  stratovolcano  located in the  Antofagasta Region  of northern Chile, just west of the border with Bolivia and within the  Alto Loa National Reserve . Part of the  Central Volcanic Zone  of the  Andes , it takes the form of a ridge, with a maximum height of 6,176 metres (20,262 ft). The volcano is embedded in a larger cluster of volcanoes known as the Aucanquilcha cluster. This was formed in stages over 11 million years of activity with varying magma output, including  lava domes  and  lava flows . Aucanquilcha was formed from four units that erupted between 1.04 and 0.23 million years ago. During the  ice ages , both the principal Aucanquilcha complex and the other volcanoes of the cluster were subject to  glaciation , resulting in the formation of  moraines  and  cirques .
