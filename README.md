>The  pomelo  ( Citrus maxima ) is the largest  citrus fruit  from the family  Rutaceae  and the principal  ancestor  of the  grapefruit . It is a natural, non-hybrid citrus fruit, native to  Southeast Asia . Growing on a tree 5–15 meters (16–50 feet) in height, the fruit is 15–25 cm (6–10 in) in diameter with a usual weight of 1–2 kilograms (2–4 pounds) and has a thicker  rind  than a grapefruit. It is divided into 11 to 18 segments and its flesh tastes like a mild grapefruit, with little of its common bitterness. The fruit generally contains few, relatively large seeds, but some varieties have numerous seeds.
