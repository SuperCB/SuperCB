>Leptura quadrifasciata , the longhorn beetle, is a species of  beetle  in the family  Cerambycidae . It is found throughout the northern and central  Palaearctic  region. The species is distributed in northern and central regions of Europe and Asia. It is particularly common in Scandinavia, Finland and Great Britain, and typically seen during the summer months. The larvae make meandering galleries in various trees, including  oak ,  beech ,  birch ,  willow ,  alder ,  elder  and  spruce  – typically in dead and decaying wood, with a preference for damp areas. Adult beetles are 11 to 20 millimetres (0.43 to 0.79 in) long, black with four more or less continuous transverse yellow bands. In extreme cases the  elytra  may be almost entirely black. The life cycle of the species lasts two or three years. This  L. quadrifasciata  female was photographed on  wild carrot  flowers near  Keila , Estonia.
