>Laodicea on the Lycus  was an ancient city in  Asia Minor , situated on a hill above the river  Lycus . It was located in the  Hellenistic  regions of  Caria  and  Lydia , which later became the Roman Province of  Phrygia Pacatiana . It is now situated near the modern city of  Denizli  in Turkey. Laodicea was built on the site of an earlier pre-Hellenistic settlement, and was founded by  Antiochus II Theos , the king of the  Seleucid Empire  from 261 to 253 BC, in honour of his wife  Laodice , together with several other cities of the same name. Laodicea became a wealthy city, and was later controlled by the  Roman  and  Byzantine  empires. The city had a large Jewish population, dating from the time of  Antiochus the Great , who transported 2000 Jewish families there from  Babylonia . It also became an early seat of  Christianity  with a  bishopric . The  Epistle to the Colossians  mentions Laodicea as one of the communities of concern for  Paul the Apostle . The city was destroyed in an earthquake in around AD 60, and subsequently rebuilt. It was eventually destroyed during the invasions of the  Turks  and  Mongols  during the second millennium, and is now a ruin. This photograph taken in 2020 shows the remains of a colonnaded Laodicean street.
