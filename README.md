>Steamboat Willie  is a 1928 American animated short film directed by  Walt Disney  and  Ub Iwerks . It marks  Mickey Mouse  and  Minnie Mouse 's first appearance in a distributed film. Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , created by the Disney studio but owned at the time by  Universal Pictures , and when two silent films featuring Mickey failed to gain a distributor, Walt Disney decided instead to put him in a  sound cartoon  – perhaps inspired by  The Jazz Singer . With music arranged by  Wilfred Jackson  and Bert Lewis,  Steamboat Willie  was one of the first cartoons with synchronized sound. The film received wide critical acclaim upon its release, and it has been preserved in the United States  National Film Registry  for its significance. The film enters the  public domain  under U.S. copyright law today (January 1, 2024), 95 years after its release in 1928.
