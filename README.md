>Daniel Bernoulli  (1700–1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist, one of several prominent mathematicians of the  Bernoulli family  from Basel. He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially  fluid mechanics , and for his pioneering work in  probability  and  statistics . His name is commemorated in  Bernoulli's principle , a particular example of the  conservation of energy , and which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the  carburetor  and the airplane  wing . This  oil-on-canvas  portrait of Bernoulli, painted by an unknown artist, now hangs in the  Basel Historical Museum .
