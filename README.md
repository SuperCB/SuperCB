>AG Carinae  is a  luminous blue variable star  in the constellation  Carina . It is one of the  most luminous stars  in the  Milky Way , although its great distance from Earth (20,000  light-years ) and intervening  interstellar dust  mean that the star is not usually visible to the naked eye; its  apparent brightness  varies erratically between magnitude 5.7 and 9.0. Apparently in a transitional phase between a massive  class -O  blue supergiant  and a  Wolf–Rayet star , AG Carinae is highly unstable and suffers from erratic pulsations, occasional larger outbursts, and rare massive eruptions. The star is surrounded by a  nebula  of ejected material at a distance of 0.4 to 1.2  parsecs  (1.3 to 3.9 light-years). The nebula contains around 15  solar masses  of material, all lost from the star around 10,000 years ago. This photograph of AG Carinae and its surrounding nebula was taken by the  Hubble Space Telescope  in 2021, as one of  its anniversary images .
