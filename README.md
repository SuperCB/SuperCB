>Al-Hajj  is the  22nd chapter  ( surah ) of the  Quran , describing the pilgrimage to  Mecca  known as the  Hajj . This Chinese scroll in ink, watercolour and gold on paper was produced in the second half of the 19th century, contains the full text of the chapter in Arabic, and is now part of the  Khalili Collection of Hajj and the Arts of Pilgrimage . Almost five metres (16 feet) in length, the scroll's illustrations include  a map entitled "Routes of the Hajj", a view of the  Great Wall of China , and views of Mecca and  Medina , as well as diagrammatic depictions of the stations of pilgrimage and Jerusalem, including the  Kaaba . The illustrations are captioned in Chinese.
