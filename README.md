>Picea omorika , commonly known as the Pančić spruce or the Serbian spruce, is a species of  coniferous  tree endemic to the valley of the  Drina  in western Serbia, and eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a total range of only about 60 hectares (150 acres) at altitudes of 800 to 1,600 metres (2,625 to 5,249 ft). The species was originally discovered near the Serbian village of  Zaovine  on  Mount Tara  in 1875, and named by the Serbian botanist  Josif Pančić . It is a medium-sized  evergreen  tree that generally grows to a height of around 20 metres (66 ft), with a trunk diameter of up to 1 metre (3 ft). It has buff-brown shoots with dense hair coverage and needle-like leaves. Its  cones  are fusiform in shape and grow to a length of 4 to 7 centimetres (2 to 3 in). They are dark purple when young, maturing to dark brown, and have stiff scales. This young female  P. omorika  cone, with a length of 22 millimetres (0.87 in), was photographed near  Keila , Estonia.
