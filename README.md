>The  cinnamon teal  ( Spatula cyanoptera ) is a species of  dabbling duck  found in western North and South America. It is a migratory species, travelling to northern South America and the Caribbean during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. The cinnamon teal lives in marshes and ponds, and feeds mostly on plants. It has a typical length of 16 in (41 cm), with a wing span of 22 inch (56 cm) and a mass of 14 oz (400 g). The male has bright reddish plumage with a duller brown coloration on the female. The bird feeds predominantly by dabbling, with its main diet being plants and sometimes  molluscs  and aquatic  insects . This cinnamon teal was photographed at the Parrot World animal park in  Crécy-la-Chapelle , France.
