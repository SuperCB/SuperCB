>Haane Manahi  (1913–1986) was a New Zealand  Māori  soldier who served in the Second World War with the  Māori Battalion . He joined the battalion in 1939 and fought in the  German invasion of Greece , the  Battle of Crete  and the  North African campaign . In April 1943, during the  Tunisian campaign , his gallantry in an action at  Takrouna  resulted in a recommendation, supported by four generals, that he be awarded the  Victoria Cross . This was downgraded to an award of the  Distinguished Conduct Medal , which disappointed many of his fellow soldiers. After his death in a car crash in 1986, representations were made for a posthumous award of the Victoria Cross for his valour at Takrouna. These representations were unsuccessful but eventually resulted in a special award in 2007 of an altar cloth for use in a local church, a ceremonial sword, and a personal letter from  Queen Elizabeth II  in recognition of his gallantry. This June 1943 photograph of Manahi was taken in  Maadi , Egypt, by George Robert Bull, the official photographer of the New Zealand armed forces.
