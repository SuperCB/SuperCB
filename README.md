>Warming stripes  (sometimes referred to as climate stripes or climate timelines) are  graphics  that use a series of chronologically ordered coloured stripes to visualize trends in the  temperature record of Earth . They employ a minimalist style, avoiding technical distractions by using colour alone to intuitively convey trends in  global warming  to non-scientists. The initial concept of visualizing historical temperature data has been extended to use  animations , to visualize sea level rise and predictive climate data, and to visually juxtapose temperature trends with other data series, such as the concentration of  carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere ,  global glacier retreat ,  precipitation , the  contribution of aviation emissions to global warming , and  biodiversity loss . These warming stripes were published by the British climatologist  Ed Hawkins  in 2018, using data from the  World Meteorological Organization . The colours represent the annual mean global temperature for each year from 1850 (left) to 2018 (right) – the progression from blue (cooler) to red (warmer) stripes is indicative of global warming.
