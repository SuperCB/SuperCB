>Edith Roosevelt  (August 6, 1861 – September 30, 1948) was the second wife of President  Theodore Roosevelt , serving as  First Lady of the United States  during his presidency from 1901 to 1909, and previously as  Second Lady of the United States  in 1901 while her husband was  Vice President . She was the first to employ a full-time, salaried social secretary as First Lady. Her tenure resulted in the creation of an official staff, and her formal dinners and ceremonial processions served to elevate the position. This photographic portrait of Roosevelt was taken by the American photographer  Frances Benjamin Johnston .
