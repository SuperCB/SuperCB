>Doris Miller  (October 12, 1919 – November 24, 1943) was a  United States Navy  cook who was the first black American to be awarded the  Navy Cross , the highest decoration for valor in combat after the  Medal of Honor . Miller served aboard  USS  West Virginia , a battleship that was sunk by Japanese  torpedo bombers  during the surprise  attack on Pearl Harbor  on December 7, 1941. During the attack, he helped several sailors who were wounded, and shot down several Japanese planes while manning an  anti-aircraft machine gun  for which he had no training. Miller's actions earned him the Navy Cross, and the resulting publicity for Miller in the black press made him an iconic emblem of the fight for civil rights for black Americans. On November 24, 1943, Miller was killed while serving aboard the escort carrier  USS  Liscome Bay  when it was sunk by a Japanese submarine during the  Battle of Makin  in the  Gilbert Islands . The destroyer escort  USS  Miller  (reclassified as a frigate in 1975), in service from 1973 to 1991, was named after him. In 2020, the Navy announced that a  Gerald R. Ford -class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier  would be named  USS  Doris Miller . The ship is scheduled to be  laid down  in 2026 and launched in 2029. This U.S. Navy photograph of Miller was taken in 1942.
