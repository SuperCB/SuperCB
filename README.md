>Argiope versicolor  also known as the multi-coloured Saint Andrew's cross spider, is a species of  orb-weaver spider  found mostly in Southeast Asia, from China to Indonesia. Like other members of the genus, females sometimes decorate their web with a zig-zag  stabilimentum  of white  silk , which varies in shape from discoid in juveniles to cruciform in mature females. The stabilimentum may be associated with predator-avoidance behaviours. The female usually sits head down in the centre of the web, with legs held spread-eagle in an "X" shape. The male is smaller and duller than the female, is brown- and cream-coloured, and its web is not decorated by zig-zag white bands. This  A. versicolor  female was photographed on the island of  Don Det  in Laos.
