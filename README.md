>Dred Scott  ( c.  1799  – 1858) was an  enslaved African American  who, along with his wife,  Harriet Robinson Scott , unsuccessfully sued for the freedom of themselves and their two daughters, Eliza and Lizzie, in the 1857 legal case  Dred Scott v. Sandford . The Scotts claimed that they should be granted freedom because Dred had lived for four years in Illinois and the  Wisconsin Territory , where slavery was illegal, and laws in those jurisdictions said that slave holders gave up their rights to slaves if they stayed for an extended period. The  Supreme Court of the United States  ruled against Scott in a  landmark decision  that held the  Constitution  did not extend  American citizenship  to people of black African descent, and therefore they could not enjoy the  rights and privileges that the Constitution conferred upon American citizens . The  Dred Scott  decision is widely considered the worst in the Supreme Court's history, being widely denounced for its overt  racism ,  judicial activism , poor legal reasoning, and crucial role in  the events that led to  the  American Civil War  four years later. The ruling was later superseded by the passage of the  Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which abolished slavery, in 1865, followed by the  Fourteenth Amendment , whose first section  guaranteed birthright citizenship  for "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof", in 1868. This posthumous oil-on-canvas portrait of Scott was painted by Louis Schultze, after an 1857 photograph by John H. Fitzgibbon, and now hangs in the  Missouri History Museum  in  St. Louis .
