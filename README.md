>Clara McAdow  (1838–1896) was an American women's suffragist and mine owner. Born in  Ohio , she grew up in  Jackson, Michigan , relocating to  Montana  with her first husband, C. E. Tomlinson. When Tomlinson died, she took their savings and invested in real estate in  Billings . Through her real-estate ventures, she met her second husband, Perry McAdow. She purchased from him the Spotted Horse mine, which he had received as payment for a debt. Clara took charge of all aspects of the mine, directing all of its operations and often living on site. McAdow was intensely interested in  the women's suffrage movement , hosting  Carrie Chapman Catt  and  Susan B. Anthony  in her home to promote giving women the vote.
