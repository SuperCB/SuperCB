>Pinguicula vulgaris , the common butterwort, is a perennial  carnivorous plant  in the  Lentibulariaceae  family. It has a generally  circumboreal  distribution, being native to almost every country in Europe as well as Russia, Canada and the United States. Growing to a height of 3 to 16 centimetres (1.2 to 6.3 inches), it is topped with a purple and occasionally white funnel-shaped flower that is 15 millimetres (0.59 in) or longer. The plant, which is  insectivorous , grows in damp environments such as bogs and swamps, in low or subalpine elevations. Its leaves have glands that excrete a sticky fluid that traps insects; its glands also produce digestive enzymes that work to consume the insects externally. This  P. vulgaris  flower was photographed in  Keila , Estonia.
