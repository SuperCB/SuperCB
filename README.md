>Acanthite  is a form of  silver sulfide  with the chemical formula Ag 2 S. It was first described in 1855 for an occurrence in the  Ore Mountains  in the present-day Czech Republic. The name is derived from the Greek "akantha" meaning thorn or arrow, in reference to its crystal shape. Acanthite crystallizes in the  monoclinic system  and is the stable form of silver sulfide below 173 °C (343 °F). As  argentite  cools below that temperature, its cubic form is distorted to the monoclinic form of acanthite. This crystal of acanthite, with dimensions of 4.0 cm × 2.5 cm × 1.5 cm (1.57 in × 0.98 in × 0.59 in), was extracted from a mine in  Imider , in the  Jbel Saghro , a mountain range in Morocco.
