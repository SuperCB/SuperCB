>Anna Bartels  (1869–1950) was a Swedish operatic  soprano  and  mezzo-soprano . She made her debut at the  Royal Swedish Opera  in 1897 in the title role of  Friedrich von Flotow 's  Martha . Engaged by the company for the next 20 years, she appeared in many Swedish premieres, such as Musette in Puccini's  La bohème  (1901), Marianne in Richard Strauss's  Der Rosenkavalier  (1920) and La Ciesca in Puccini's  Gianni Schicchi  (1920). Other works in which she appeared include  The Merry Wives of Windsor ,  The Magic Flute ,  Don Giovanni  and  Carmen . Bartels is also remembered for her appearances in concerts and  lieder  recitals. She was awarded the  Litteris et Artibus  medal in 1923 for her contributions to Swedish culture. This 1901 photograph by the Swedish photographer Ferdinand Flodin shows Bartels in her role as Musette.
