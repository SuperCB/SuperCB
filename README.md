>Magna Lykseth-Skogman  (6 February 1874 – 13 November 1949) was a Norwegian-born Swedish operatic soprano. After making her debut at the  Royal Swedish Opera  (Kungliga Operan) in 1901 as Santuzza in  Cavalleria rusticana , she was engaged there until 1918 and became the company's  prima donna . Lykseth performed leading roles in a wide range of operas but is remembered in particular for her Wagnerian interpretations, creating Brünnhilde in the Swedish premieres of  Siegfried  and  Götterdämmerung , as well as Isolde in  Tristan und Isolde  in 1909. Considered to be one of the most outstanding Swedish opera singers of her generation, she was awarded the  Litteris et Artibus , a Swedish royal medal for the arts, in 1907 and became a member of the  Royal Swedish Academy of Music  in 1912. This 1909 photograph shows Lykseth in costume as Isolde with the Kungliga Operan.
