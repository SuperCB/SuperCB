>Sedum acre , commonly known as the biting stonecrop, is a perennial  flowering plant  in the family  Crassulaceae . It is native to Europe, North Africa and parts of Asia, and is naturalised in other places such as North America and New Zealand. It is a low-growing plant which is adapted for growth on thin dry soils, being found on terrain including dry grassland, beaches, drystone walls and roadside verges. The plant forms mat-like stands up to 12 centimetres (5 inches) tall. For most of the year the stems are short with dense leaf coverage, but during the flowering season  in June and July, the stems lengthen and become erect. This  S. acre  plant with a length of 3.5 centimetres (1.4 inches) was photographed in  Niitvälja , Estonia.
