>A  peanut , also known as a groundnut, is the fruit of  Arachis hypogaea , a plant in the family  Fabaceae . The peanut is classed as a grain  legume  rather than as a botanical  nut , although in culinary and colloquial use it is generally treated as one. Uses of peanuts include consumption as a snack and in various dishes,  peanut butter , and – due to its high oil content – as a  vegetable oil .  Peanuts cause allergic reactions  in some humans. Clockwise from top left, this photograph shows a peanut with its shell cracked open, a whole unshelled peanut, an unpeeled peanut seed, a halved peeled seed, and a whole peeled seed. This picture was  focus-stacked  from 31 separate images.
