>The  red panda  is a  mammal  native to the  eastern Himalayas  and  southwestern China . It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, and a ringed tail. It has a head-to-body length of 51–63.5 cm (20–25 in) and a 28–48.5 cm (11–19 in) tail, and it weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg (7 and 33 lb). It is genetically close to  raccoons ,  weasels  and  skunks . Solitary, largely  arboreal  and well adapted to climbing, it inhabits  coniferous ,  temperate broadleaf and mixed forests , favouring steep slopes with dense  bamboo  cover close to water sources. It uses elongated wrist bones ("false thumbs") to grasp bamboo. It feeds mainly on  bamboo shoots  and leaves. Red pandas mate in early spring, giving birth to litters of up to four cubs in summer. On the  IUCN Red List  as  endangered  since 2015, the species is threatened by  poaching  and  deforestation -based habitat  destruction  and  fragmentation .
