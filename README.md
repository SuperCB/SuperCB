>The  hairy dragonfly  ( Brachytron pratense ) is a species of European  dragonfly  in the hawker family,  Aeshnidae . It is found in Europe and Asia Minor, as far east as the  Caspian Sea , and resides close to water bodies containing plants with a flight season running from May to July. The hairy dragonfly is named for its hairy  thorax , distinguishing it from other hawkers. With a typical length of around 5.5 centimetres (2.2 in), it has a long, narrow  pterostigma  and features coupled, oval-shaped markings on its abdomen, blue on males and yellow on females. This male hairy dragonfly on a  fern  was photographed in  Burren National Park , County Clare, Ireland.
