>The  Alcobaça Monastery  is a Catholic  monastic complex  located in the town of  Alcobaça, Portugal , 120 km north of  Lisbon . It was established in 1153 by the first Portuguese king,  Afonso Henriques , and developed a close association with the Portuguese monarchy throughout its history, leading it to become the richest and most influential monastery in Portugal. By 1300, it had a population of almost 1,000 monks and business interests including farming, fishing and trade. It closed in 1834, amid the  dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal . Due to its artistic, cultural and historical relevance as one of Portugal's oldest  Gothic  buildings, the monastery and its church were included in UNESCO's  World Heritage Site  list in 1989.
