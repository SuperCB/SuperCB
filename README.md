>The  rosy-faced lovebird  ( Agapornis roseicollis ), also known as the rosy-collared or peach-faced lovebird, is a species of  lovebird  native to arid regions in southwestern Africa such as the  Namib . A loud and constant chirper, they are very social and often congregate in small groups in the wild. They eat throughout the day and take frequent baths. Coloration can vary widely among populations, and plumage is identical in males and females. Lovebirds are renowned for their sleep position in which they sit side-by-side and turn their faces in towards each other. Females are well noted to tear raw materials into long strips, "twisty-tie" them onto their backs, and fly substantial distances back to make a nest. These photographs of a rosy-faced lovebird of the subspecies  A. r. roseicollis , seen from the front (top) and the back (bottom), were taken in  Erongo Region , Namibia.
