>In archaeology, the  Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex  (BMAC), also known as the Oxus Civilization, refers to a Middle  Bronze Age  civilization of southern Central Asia, existing in its urban phase from circa 2400 to 1950 BC. Most of the BMAC's urban sites are actually located in  Margiana  (modern Turkmenistan) on the  Marghab River  delta, and in the  Kopet Dag  mountains. There are a few later sites in northern  Bactria , in what is now southern Uzbekistan, but these are mostly graveyards belonging to the BMAC-related Sapalli culture. A single BMAC site lies in southern Bactria, in the north of modern Afghanistan. Sites found further east, in southwestern Tajikistan, though contemporary with the main BMAC sites in Margiana, are only graveyards, with no urban developments associated with them. This BMAC statuette of a seated female is an example of a "Bactrian princess", dating to between the late 3rd and early 2nd millennium BC. It is made of  steatite  or  chlorite  and  alabaster , with dimensions of  .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 3 + 9 ⁄ 16  in ×  3 + 11 ⁄ 16  in ×  1 + 7 ⁄ 8  in (9.0 cm × 9.4 cm × 4.8 cm). The sculpture is now in the collection of the  Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York City.
