>The  titan beetle  ( Titanus giganteus ) is a  Neotropical  species of  longhorn beetle . It is one of the largest known  beetles , as well as one of the largest known insects, at more than 170 millimetres (6.7 inches) in length. Adult titan beetles only live for a few weeks, and protect themselves from predators with their sharp spines and powerful jaws. The species is native to  tropical rainforests  throughout South America, primarily the  Amazon rainforest , and is primarily found in  old-growth forests  with plenty of rotting wood, which serves as their principal food supply. Despite a broad distribution throughout South America, it is secretive and rarely seen due to its  nocturnal  habits and cryptic behavior. These three male titan beetles, collected in  French Guiana , are in the collection of the  Muséum de Toulouse  in France.
