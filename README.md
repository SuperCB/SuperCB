>Nader Shah Afshar  (6 August 1698 or 22 October 1688 – 20 June 1747) was the founder of the  Afsharid dynasty  of  Iran  and one of the most powerful rulers in  Iranian history , ruling as  shah of Iran  from 1736 to 1747, when he was assassinated during a rebellion. He fought  numerous campaigns  throughout the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and South Asia, emerging victorious from the battles of  Herat ,  Mihmandust ,  Murche-Khort ,  Kirkuk ,  Yeghevārd ,  Khyber Pass ,  Karnal , and  Kars . He has been described as "the last great Asiatic military conqueror", and his victories during his campaigns briefly made him  West Asia 's most powerful sovereign, ruling over what was arguably the most powerful empire in the world. Nader also changed the Iranian coinage system, minting silver coins, called  Naderi , that were equal to the Mughal  rupee . This silver coin was minted in  Dagestan  and is dated 1741–1742.
