>The  western meadowlark  ( Sturnella neglecta ) is a medium-sized species of bird in the family  Icteridae , the icterids. About 8.5 inches (22 centimetres) in length, it is found across western and central North America. It is a  full migrant , breeding in Canada and the United States with resident populations also found in Mexico. The species has distinctive calls described as watery or flute-like, which distinguish it from the closely related  eastern meadowlark . The western meadowlark is the  state bird  of six U.S. states:  Kansas ,  Montana ,  Nebraska ,  North Dakota ,  Oregon , and  Wyoming . This western meadowlark was photographed perching on a twig in  Grasslands National Park , in the Canadian province of  Saskatchewan .
