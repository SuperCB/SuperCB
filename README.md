>The  Continental  XI-1430  (often identified as the  IV-1430 ) was a liquid-cooled  aircraft engine  developed in the United States by a partnership between the  United States Army Air Corps  (USAAC) and  Continental Motors . It resulted from the USAAC's  hyper-engine  efforts that started in 1932, but never entered widespread production as it was not better than other available engines when it finally matured. In 1939, the  I-1430-3  was designated as the engine to power the  Curtiss  XP-55 , a radical  pusher-engine  fighter design that did not reach production. This  I-1430-11  engine is in the collection of the  National Air and Space Museum  at the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.
