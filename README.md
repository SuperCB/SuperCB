>Walter White  (1893–1955) was an American civil rights activist who led the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  (NAACP) for a quarter of a century, from 1929 until his death. He directed a broad program of legal challenges to  racial segregation  and  disfranchisement . Under his leadership, the NAACP oversaw the plans and organizational structure of the fight against public segregation in the United States. He worked with President  Harry S. Truman  on desegregating the armed forces after  World War II  and gave him a draft of  Executive Order 9981  to implement this. Under White's leadership, the NAACP set up its  Legal Defense Fund , which conducted numerous legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement, and achieved many successes. This photograph of White was taken by  Clara Sipprell  around 1950, and is in the collection of the  National Portrait Gallery  in Washington, D.C.
