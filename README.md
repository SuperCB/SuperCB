>Sherman's March to the Sea  was a military campaign of the  American Civil War  conducted through  Georgia  by Major General  William Tecumseh Sherman  of the  Union Army . The campaign began on November 15, 1864, with Sherman's troops leaving  Atlanta , recently  taken by Union forces , and ended with the capture of the port of  Savannah  on December 21. His forces followed a " scorched earth " policy, destroying military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property, disrupting the  Confederacy's economy and transportation networks . The operation debilitated the Confederacy and helped lead to its eventual surrender. This picture shows an engraving by  Alexander Hay Ritchie  depicting Sherman's March to the Sea.
