>All Saints' Day , also known as All Hallows' Day or Hallowmas, is a  Christian   solemnity  celebrated in honour of all the  saints  of the church, whether they are known or unknown. In the 9th century, some churches in the  British Isles  began holding the commemoration of all saints on 1 November, and in the 9th century this was extended to the whole Catholic church by  Pope Gregory IV . In  Western Christianity , it is still celebrated on 1 November by the  Roman Catholic Church  as well as many Protestant churches, as the  Lutheran ,  Anglican , and  Methodist  traditions. This view of the Holy Cross Cemetery in  Gniezno , Poland, shows candles and flowers placed to honour deceased relatives on All Saints' Day. It is observed as a public and bank holiday in Poland, the following day also being commemorated in the country as  Zaduszki  (All Souls' Day).
