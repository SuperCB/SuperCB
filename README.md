>Prehnite  is an  inosilicate  mineral of  calcium  and  aluminium  with the  chemical formula  Ca 2 Al(AlSi 3 O 10 )(OH) 2 . Limited  Fe 3+  substitutes for aluminium in the structure. Prehnite crystallizes in the  orthorhombic crystal system , and most often forms as stalactitic,  botryoidal , reniform or globular aggregates. Prehnite is brittle with an uneven fracture and a vitreous to pearly luster. It has a hardness of 6.5 on the  Mohs scale  and its  specific gravity  is 2.80 to 2.95, while its color varies from light green to yellow, with some specimens also colorless. Prehnite is used as a gemstone, and was first described in 1788 for an occurrence in the  Karoo dolerites  of  Cradock  in the  Eastern Cape  of South Africa. It was named after Colonel Hendrik Von Prehn, the commander of the military forces of the Dutch colony at the  Cape of Good Hope  from 1768 to 1780. This prehnite crystal, measuring 4.0 cm × 3.5 cm × 2.0 cm (1.6 in × 1.4 in × 0.8 in), was found in  Southbury, Connecticut , in the United States.
