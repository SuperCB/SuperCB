>The  Garni Temple  is a  classical   colonnaded  structure in the village of  Garni , in central Armenia, around 30 km (19 mi) east of  Yerevan . Built in the  Ionic order , it is the best-known structure and symbol of  pre-Christian Armenia . It has been described as the "easternmost building of the  Greco-Roman world " and the only largely preserved Hellenistic building in the  former Soviet Union . It is conventionally identified as a pagan temple built by King  Tiridates I  in the first century AD as a temple to the sun god  Mihr  ( Mithra ). It collapsed in  a 1679 earthquake , but much of its fragments remained on the site. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations in the early and mid-20th century. It was reconstructed in 1969–75, using the  anastylosis  technique. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of  Hetanism  (Armenian neopaganism). This  aerial photograph  shows the Garni Temple in the winter.
