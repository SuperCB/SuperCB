>St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate , is a  Church of England parish church  in the district of  Marylebone  in London. The church was consecrated in 1903, but the  parish  was founded in 1866. Dedicated to  Cyprian , a 3rd-century  martyr  and Bishop of Carthage, it is near the Clarence Gate Gardens entrance to  Regent's Park , off  Baker Street . The present church was designed by Ninian Comper and is a Grade II*  listed building . The parish was formed by the efforts of noted "slum priest" Charles Gutch, who wanted a church of his own in London. Gutch negotiated that a small portion of St Paul's parish be transferred to a new mission district where church attendance was in any case poor. The district was about one-tenth the area of the parish, but it was densely populated due to the overcrowded slums that at that time occupied much of it. This photograph depicts the  nave  of the church, looking towards the altar in the background.
