>Harriet Jacobs  (1813 or 1815 – 1897) was an African-American writer who was born into slavery in  Edenton, North Carolina . During her teenage years, seeking protection from sexual harassment by her enslaver James Norcom, she began a relationship with the white lawyer  Samuel Sawyer , who became the father of her children Joseph and  Louisa Matilda . When Norcom threatened to sell her children if she did not submit to his desire, Jacobs escaped and hid in a tiny crawl space under the roof of her grandmother's house, so low that she could not stand up in it. After staying there for seven years, she finally managed to escape to the free  North , where she was reunited with her children. In 1861, she published an  autobiography  titled  Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl  under the  pseudonym  Linda Brent, a book which was later described by her biographer  Jean Fagan Yellin  as an "American classic". This portrait of Jacobs, her only known formal photograph, was taken in 1894 by Gilbert Studios in Washington, D.C.
