>Abraham Bradley Jr.  (1767–1838) was an American lawyer, judge, and  cartographer  who served as Assistant Postmaster General for 30 years during the earliest history of the  United States Post Office Department . He was responsible for moving the federal government's post office from  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , to the new capital at  Washington, D.C. , and briefly hosted the national post office in his own home. The continuity brought by Bradley's long employment during the tenures of five  United States postmasters general  helped establish the budding postal service as a reliable provider; he also drew detailed and innovative postal route maps that built the office's efficiency. He drew one of the first comprehensive maps of the United States in 1796; it "represented the first clear cartographic break in European-dominated map making and introduced a new, more distinctly American style of cartography to the United States". In 1804, Bradley drew this map of American  post roads  and  post offices , spanning the  Orleans Territory  (now  Louisiana ) in the southwest to  Maine  in the northeast. The hand-colored map measures 98 by 132 centimeters (39 in × 52 in).
