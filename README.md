>Ålesund  is a town and municipality in  Møre og Romsdal  county, Norway. The centre of the town lies on the islands of  Hessa ,  Aspøya , and  Nørvøya  with newer developments located on the islands of  Oksenøya . According to local legend, Ålesund was founded by Gangerolf ( Rollo ) in the 9th century. In 1848, it was given the status of a town. In 1904, the town was largely destroyed  in a fire  and subsequently rebuilt, with most of the buildings constructed of stone in  Art Nouveau  style. This photograph depicts a view of Ålesund in September 2019 as seen from Aksla, a viewpoint over the town.
