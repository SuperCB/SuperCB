>The  Isaiah Scroll , designated 1QIsa a  and also known as the Great Isaiah Scroll, is one of the seven  Dead Sea Scrolls  that were discovered by  Bedouin  shepherds in 1946 from the  Qumran Caves  in the  Judaean Desert , near the  Dead Sea . The scroll is written in  Hebrew  and contains the entire  Book of Isaiah  from beginning to end, apart from a few small damaged portions. It is the oldest complete copy of the Book of Isaiah, being approximately one thousand years older than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts known before the scrolls' discovery. 1QIsa a  is the only scroll from the Qumran Caves to be preserved almost in its entirety.
