>Gerty Cori  (1896–1957) was a Czech-American biochemist. She was the third woman to win a  Nobel Prize  in science, and the first woman to be awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , for her significant role in the "discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of  glycogen ". Born in  Prague , Cori grew up at a time when women were marginalized in science and allowed few educational opportunities, but she nonetheless gained admittance to medical school. With her husband  Carl Ferdinand Cori  and the Argentine physiologist  Bernardo Houssay , she received the Nobel Prize in 1947. This photograph from the  Smithsonian Institution Archives , taken in the same year, shows Cori and her husband working in their laboratory.
