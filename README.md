>The  Battle of Shiloh , also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, was a major battle in the  American Civil War  fought on April 6–7, 1862. The fighting took place in southwestern  Tennessee , which was part of the war's  western theater . Two Union armies combined to defeat the Confederate  Army of Mississippi . Major General  Ulysses S. Grant  was the Union commander, while General  Albert Sidney Johnston  was the Confederate commander until his battlefield death, when he was replaced by his second-in-command, General  P. G. T. Beauregard . Though victorious, the Union army had more casualties than the Confederates, and with an overall total of almost 24,000 injuries and fatalities, it was one of the bloodiest battles in the entire war. This  chromolithograph  of the Battle of Shiloh was produced by American illustrator  Thure de Thulstrup  and printed by  L. Prang & Co.  in Boston in 1888.
