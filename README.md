>Oregano  ( Origanum vulgare ) is a species of  flowering plant  in the mint family,  Lamiaceae . It was native to the  Mediterranean region , but widely naturalised elsewhere in the  temperate  Northern Hemisphere. A relative of the herb  marjoram , oregano has purple, pink or white flowers and spade-shaped, olive-green leaves. It is a  perennial , but it is grown as an annual in colder climates as it often does not survive the winter. Oregano leaves are widely used as a culinary  herb , and its oil is often used as a dietary supplement, although there is no clinical evidence that it has any effect on human health. This photograph of an  inflorescence  of oregano was taken in  Keila , Estonia; the petals of the flowers depicted are approximately 5 millimetres (0.20 inches) in length. This picture was  focus-stacked  from 66 separate images.
