>Marilyn Monroe  (1926–1962) was an American model and actress. One of the most popular sex symbols of the  1950s , she played stereotypically " dumb blonde " characters that were emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. After beginning her career as a  pin-up model , she had two short-lived film contracts before being signed by  20th Century-Fox  in 1951. The next year, scandalous nude photographs of her were featured in a popular calendar. She became one of the most bankable  Hollywood  stars with starring roles in comedies such as  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes  (1953),  How to Marry a Millionaire  (1953), and  The Seven Year Itch  (1955). Disappointed in being  typecast  and underpaid, Monroe formed her own production company in 1955 and successfully fought for a better contract with Fox. She received critical acclaim for her performances in  Bus Stop  (1956) and  Some Like It Hot  (1959), winning a  Golden Globe for Best Actress  for the latter. Her last completed film was the drama  The Misfits  (1961). Troubled by mental health and addiction problems, Monroe died of a  barbiturate overdose  in 1962. She continues to be considered a  popular culture  icon. This  Associated Press  photograph of Monroe was taken on September 9, 1954, during the filming of  The Seven Year Itch  on the streets of New York. She is wearing  her white dress , worn in the "skirt scene" in which air from a subway grate blows up her skirt.
