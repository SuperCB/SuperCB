>The Sleeping Gypsy  is an 1897 oil-on-canvas by the French  Naïve  artist  Henri Rousseau . It is a fantastical depiction of a lion musing over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night. Rousseau first exhibited the painting at the 13th  Salon des Indépendants , and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the mayor of his hometown,  Laval . It instead entered the private collection of a Parisian charcoal merchant, where it remained until 1924, when it was discovered by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles. The Paris-based art dealer  Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler  purchased the painting in 1924, although a controversy arose over whether the painting was a forgery. It was acquired by art historian  Alfred H. Barr Jr.  for the  Museum of Modern Art  in New York, where it remains.
