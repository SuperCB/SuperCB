>Louis Blanc  (29 October 1811 – 6 December 1882) was a French politician and historian. He advocated for  socialist  reforms without  revolution  first, and called for the creation of  job guarantees  for the urban poor. Blanc coined the phrase " right to work ", and his political and social ideas greatly contributed to the development of  socialism in France . This photograph of Blanc was taken in 1848 by the French photographer  Étienne Carjat .
