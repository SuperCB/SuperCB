>The  buff-tailed coronet  ( Boissonneaua flavescens ) is a species of  hummingbird  in the "brilliants", members of the tribe  Heliantheini  in the subfamily  Lesbiinae . Found in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, the buff-tailed coronet is 11 to 12 centimetres (4.3 to 4.7 inches) long and weighs 7.3 to 8.8 grams (0.26 to 0.31 ounces). Both sexes have a short, straight, black bill and a small white spot behind the eye. Males of the nominate subspecies,  B. f. flavescens , are mostly shining green, with a buff belly spotted with green. The buff-tailed coronet is highly territorial, though it may share feeding at a flowering tree with other hummingbirds. It typically forages in the mid-story but also feeds in the canopy. Breeding behavior has been recorded between November and March, and it has a song consisting of "a continuous series of single high-pitched 'tsit' notes". This buff-tailed coronet of the subspecies  B. f. flavescens  was photographed in the Reserva Ecologica Rio Blanco, near  Manizales , Colombia.
