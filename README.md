>The Goldfinch  is an oil-on-panel painting by the  Dutch Golden Age  artist  Carel Fabritius  of a life-sized chained  goldfinch . Signed and dated 1654, it is now in the collection of the  Mauritshuis  in  The Hague , Netherlands. The work is a  trompe-l'œil  painting that was once part of a larger structure, perhaps a window  jamb  or a protective cover. It is possible that the work was in Fabritius's studio in  Delft  at the time of  a large gunpowder explosion  on 12 October 1654 that killed him and destroyed much of the city. A common and colourful bird with a pleasant song, the goldfinch was a popular pet, and could be taught simple tricks including lifting a  thimble -sized bucket of water. It was reputedly a bringer of good health, and was used in  Italian Renaissance painting  as a  symbol  of  Christian redemption  and the  Passion of Jesus .  The Goldfinch  is unusual for the Dutch Golden Age painting period in the simplicity of its composition and use of illusionary techniques. Following the death of its creator, it was lost for more than two centuries before its rediscovery in  Brussels .
