>W. E. B. Du Bois  (1868–1963) was an American  sociologist ,  historian  and  civil rights activist . The first  African American  to earn a doctorate from  Harvard , he became a professor of history, sociology and economics at  Atlanta University . He rose to national prominence as the leader of the  Niagara Movement , a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks, and was one of the co-founders of the  NAACP  in 1909. He wrote one of the first scientific treatises in the field of American sociology, and published three autobiographies.   Black Reconstruction in America  (1935) challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the  Reconstruction era . On August 28, 1963, a day after his death, his book  The Souls of Black Folk  was highlighted by  Roy Wilkins  at the  March on Washington , and hundreds of thousands of marchers honored him with a moment of silence. A year later, the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , embodying many of the reforms for which he had campaigned his entire life, was enacted. This  gelatin silver print  of Du Bois was taken in 1907 by the American photographer  James E. Purdy , and is in the collection of the  National Portrait Gallery  in Washington, D.C.
