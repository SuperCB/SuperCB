>The  mangosteen  ( Garcinia mangostana ) is a tropical  evergreen  tree with edible fruit native to  Maritime Southeast Asia , from the  Malay Peninsula  to  Borneo . It is grown mainly in Southeast Asia, southwest India, and other tropical areas such as Colombia,  Puerto Rico  and  Florida , where the tree has been introduced. The fruit is sweet and tangy, juicy, somewhat fibrous, with fluid-filled vesicles (like the flesh of  citrus  fruits), with an inedible, deep reddish-purple colored rind ( exocarp ) when  ripe . In each fruit, the fragrant edible white flesh that surrounds each seed is the  endocarp , the inner layer of the  ovary , and is roughly the same shape and size as a  tangerine , about 4 to 6 centimetres (1.5 to 2.5 inches) in diameter. This photograph, which was  focus-stacked  from 22 individual images, shows two mangosteens, one whole, and the other halved to expose the endocarp.
