>The  African hawk-eagle  ( Aquila spilogaster ) is a large  bird of prey . Like all  eagles , it belongs to the family  Accipitridae . The species's feathered legs mark it as a member of the subfamily  Aquilinae . The African hawk-eagle breeds in tropical  sub-Saharan Africa . It is a bird of assorted  woodland , including both  savanna  and hilly areas, but they tend to occur in  typically dry woodland . The species tends to be rare in areas where their preferred habitat type is absent. The African hawk-eagle is powerfully built and hunts small to medium-sized mammals and birds predominantly, occasionally taking reptiles and other prey as well. This African hawk-eagle perching on a branch was photographed in  Damaraland , Namibia.
