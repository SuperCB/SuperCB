>Diamond  is a  solid form of carbon  with its atoms arranged in a  crystal structure  known as  diamond cubic . It is  metastable  at  standard temperature and pressure , converting to the  chemically stable  form  graphite  under those conditions but at a negligible rate. Diamond has the highest  hardness  and  thermal conductivity  of any natural material, properties that are useful in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. In addition to its industrial uses,  diamond is much sought-after as a gemstone  for use in jewelry. Most natural diamonds were formed between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years ago, at depths between 150 to 250 kilometres (93 to 155 mi) in the  Earth's mantle . They were then carried to the surface more recently in volcanic eruptions and deposited in  igneous rocks  known as  kimberlites  and  lamproites . This photograph shows the  cathodoluminescence  of a round-cut diamond, taken with the use of a  scanning electron microscope . The image has a field of view of 3.45 millimetres (0.136 in).
