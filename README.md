>The  1974 aluminum cent  was a  one-cent coin  proposed by the  United States Mint  in 1973. Composed of an  alloy  of  aluminum  and trace metals, it was intended to replace the predominantly  copper – zinc  cent due to the  rising costs of coin production  in the traditional  bronze  alloy. None of the 1,571,167 coins struck were released into circulation. The coin depicted here was donated to the  National Numismatic Collection  at the  Smithsonian Institution 's  National Museum of American History .
