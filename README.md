>The  white-cheeked honeyeater  ( Phylidonyris niger ) is a bird in the  honeyeater  family, Meliphagidae, native to the east coast and the south-west corner of Australia. It is black and white in colour with a long, sturdy bill that curves downwards, a large bright-yellow tail and wing panels, and a large white cheek-patch on a mainly black head. It is gregarious, active and noisy with swift, erratic flight. This white-cheeked honeyeater was photographed in  Maddens Plains  in New South Wales, Australia.
