>The  cinnamon quail-thrush  ( Cinclosoma cinnamomeum ) is a species of bird in the family  Cinclosomatidae .  Endemic  to Australia, it is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of the central part of the continent, spanning southwest  Queensland , northwest  New South Wales , northeastern  South Australia , and the southeast of the  Northern Territory . It is most commonly found among dry stony areas, especially around dry creek lines, although it is also sometimes encountered in grass and shrublands. The cinnamon quail-thrush has a body length of 20 centimetres (7.9 in) and a mass of up to 50 grams (1.8 oz) when fully grown. Male birds are characterised by a white eyebrow, black face and a broad white streak down the sides of a black throat. The upperparts of their body are plain cinnamon-rufous with buff-white patches on the upper breast and a broad black band below. The outer tail feathers are black with white tips. The female has similar features but duller with a buff-white throat and eyebrow. This cinnamon quail-thrush was photographed by the  Stuart Highway  near  Hugh, Northern Territory , about 88 kilometres (55 mi) southwest of  Alice Springs .
