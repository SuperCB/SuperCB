>The  lychee  ( Litchi chinensis ) is a tropical tree in the soapberry family,  Sapindaceae , which is native to South China, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam. It has also been introduced throughout Southeast Asia, South Asia and in parts of Southern Africa. A tall  evergreen  tree, it bears small fleshy sweet  fruits  which feature a dark brown inedible  seed , a layer of translucent white fleshy sweet  aril , and a pinkish-red, rough-textured soft shell on the outside. The aril has a floral scent and is most often eaten fresh. This photograph, which has been  focus-stacked  from 15 separate images, shows a whole lychee fruit, an opened fruit, and a seed.
