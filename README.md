>The Death of Marat  is a 1793 painting by  Jacques-Louis David  depicting the artist's friend and murdered French revolutionary leader,  Jean-Paul Marat . It was painted when David was the leading French Neoclassical painter, a  Montagnard , and a member of the revolutionary  Committee of General Security . Created in the months after Marat's death, the painting shows Marat lying dead in his bath after his murder by  Charlotte Corday  on 13 July 1793. Art historian  T. J. Clark  called David's painting the first modernist work for "the way it took the stuff of politics as its material, and did not transmute it".
