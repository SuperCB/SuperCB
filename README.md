>Edinburgh  is the capital city of  Scotland  and one of its 32  council areas . Located in the south-east of Scotland, it is bounded to the north by the  Firth of Forth  estuary and to the south by the  Pentland Hills . With a population of 506,520 in mid-2020, Edinburgh is the  second-largest city in Scotland by population  and the  seventh-largest  in the United Kingdom. The  royal burgh  of Edinburgh was founded by  King David I  in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, and has been capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century.
