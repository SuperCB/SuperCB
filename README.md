>USS  Johnston  was a  Fletcher -class destroyer  built for the  United States Navy  during  World War II . She was named after Lieutenant  John V. Johnston , a navy officer during the  American Civil War . The ship was  laid down  in May 1942 and was launched in March 1943, entering active duty later that year as part of the  US Pacific Fleet .  Johnston  provided  naval gunfire support  for American ground forces during the  Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign  in 1944 and again, after three months of patrol and escort duty in the  Solomon Islands , during  the recapture  of  Guam  in July. Thereafter,  Johnston  was tasked with escorting  escort carriers  during the  Mariana and Palau Islands campaign  and the  liberation of the Philippines . On 25 October 1944,  Johnston  and various other ships were engaged by a large  Imperial Japanese Navy  flotilla, in what became known as the  Battle off Samar . After engaging several Japanese  capital ships  and a destroyer squadron,  Johnston  was sunk with 187 dead.  Johnston ' s wreck was discovered in 2019, and at a depth of more than 20,000 feet (6,100 m) below the surface, is one of the deepest shipwrecks ever surveyed. This photograph shows  Johnston  in  Seattle  in October 1943.
