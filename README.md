>The  redcurrant  ( Ribes rubrum ) is a  deciduous  shrub in the  gooseberry  family, Grossulariaceae, which is native to western Europe. The plant normally grows to a height of up to one metre (3 ft), with its leaves arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are inconspicuous yellow-green, maturing into bright red translucent edible  berries . An established redcurrant bush can produce 3 to 4 kilograms (7 to 9 lb) of berries from mid- to late summer. The species is widely cultivated, with the berries known for their tart flavor, a characteristic provided by a relatively high content of  organic acids  and mixed  polyphenols . This photograph of a bunch of redcurrant berries was  focus-stacked  from 15 separate images.
