>The  plains-wanderer  ( Pedionomus torquatus ) is a bird in the family Pedionomidae, of which it is the only surviving species. Endemic to Australia, its historical range included  Victoria ,  New South Wales ,  South Australia  and the  Northern Territory , but in recent years it has become endangered, with remaining known populations concentrated in the Riverina (a region in southwestern New South Wales) and in western Queensland. The plains-wanderer is a  quail -like ground bird, measuring 15 to 19 centimetres (5.9 to 7.5 in). The adult male is light brown above, with fawn-white underparts with black crescents. The adult female is substantially larger than the male, and has a distinctive white-spotted black collar. This female plains-wanderer was photographed in the Riverina, north of the town of  Deniliquin , New South Wales.
