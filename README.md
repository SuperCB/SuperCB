>Leonhard Euler  (15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician and engineer. He founded the studies of  graph theory  and  topology , and made pioneering and influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics such as  analytic number theory ,  complex analysis  and  infinitesimal calculus . Euler introduced much of modern  mathematical notation  and terminology, including the notion of a  mathematical function . He is also known for his work in  mechanics ,  fluid dynamics ,  optics , astronomy and  music theory . This  pastel -on-paper portrait of Euler was painted by the Swiss painter  Jakob Emanuel Handmann  in 1753, and is now in the collection of the  Kunstmuseum Basel .
