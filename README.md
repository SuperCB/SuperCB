>Charles Darwin  (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English  naturalist ,  geologist , and  biologist , widely known for his contributions to  evolutionary biology . His proposition that all species of life have descended from a  common ancestor  is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint presentation with  Alfred Russel Wallace , he introduced his scientific theory that this  branching pattern  of  evolution  resulted from a process he called  natural selection , in which the  struggle for existence  has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in  selective breeding . Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book  On the Origin of Species . By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted  evolution as a fact . However,  many scientists initially favoured competing explanations  that gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the  modern evolutionary synthesis  from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the  life sciences , explaining the  diversity of life . Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in  human history  and was honoured by  burial in Westminster Abbey . This photograph of Darwin by  Julia Margaret Cameron  was taken around 1868.
