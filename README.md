>Zhou Fang  was a Chinese painter during the  Tang dynasty , living in the capital of  Chang'an  (modern  Xi'an ) during the 8th century. He came from a noble background and this was reflected in his works. He personally painted for the emperor and the themes of his artwork covered religious subjects and everyday life. This  ink-and-color-on-silk painting , titled  Court Ladies Playing Double-sixes , measures 30.5 cm × 69.1 cm (12.0 in × 27.2 in) and depicts members of the emperor's household playing the board game  liubo . It now hangs in the  Freer Gallery of Art  in Washington, D.C.
