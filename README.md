>The  house sparrow  ( Passer domesticus ) is a  passerine  bird of the  sparrow  family Passeridae. Originally native to Europe, the Mediterranean Basin and a large part of Asia, it is now found in most parts of the world and is the most widely distributed wild bird. It is closely associated with human habitation and resides in both urban and rural areas. The house sparrow is a small bird with a typical length of 16 cm (6.3 in) and a mass of 24–39.5 g (0.85–1.39 oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. It is sometimes considered a  pest  but is also sometimes kept as a pet or used as a food item. This male house sparrow was photographed in  Prospect Park , New York City, United States.
