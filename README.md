>George I Rákóczi  (1593–1648) was a Hungarian nobleman who served as  Prince of Transylvania  from 1630 until his death. Before acceding to the throne, he was a leader of the Protestant faction in Hungary and a faithful supporter of Prince  Gabriel Bethlen . When  Bohemian nobles  requested military support in their struggles against the  Habsburg monarchy , Rákóczi persuaded Bethlen to help and commanded Transylvanian forces in several battles. After Bethlen's death, there were short reigns by  his wife  and then  his brother , but the Transylvanian parliament elected Rákóczi as Bethlen's permanent successor. His reign was notable for his role in the  Thirty Years' War , with a campaign against  Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor , from 1644 to 1645. After Rákóczi held  Upper Hungary  and most of Lower Hungary at one point, the fighting was ended by the Treaty of Linz, under which seven counties of Upper Hungary were annexed by Transylvania. This  etching  of Rákóczi was produced in 1631 by the  Dutch Golden Age  artist  Jan Gillisz. van Vliet , after an earlier design by  Rembrandt , Van Vliet's teacher. The illustration is in the collection of the  Rijksmuseum  in Amsterdam.
