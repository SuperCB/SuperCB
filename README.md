>San Pedro  is a  composite volcano  in northern Chile and one of the tallest active volcanoes in the world. It is part of the  Andean Volcanic Belt  and, like other Andean volcanoes, was formed by the  subduction  of the  Nazca Plate  beneath the  South America Plate . San Pedro is formed of two separate edifices, the Old Cone and the Young Cone, and is adjoined to a neighbouring volcano,  San Pablo . The Old Cone was active over one hundred thousand years ago and was eventually truncated by a giant  landslide  that removed its northwestern side. Within the landslide scar  lava  flows and  pyroclastic flows  constructed the Young Cone as well as the lateral centre La Poruña. Some eruptions have been reported during historical time, and presently the volcano is  fumarolically  active. This photograph shows San Pedro in the foreground, with San Pablo visible behind it to the right.
