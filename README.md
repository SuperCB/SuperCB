>The  gatekeeper  ( Pyronia tithonus ) is a species of butterfly in the family  Nymphalidae , found across Europe. It is typically orange with two large brown spots on its wings and a brown pattern on the edge of its wings, although a large number of aberrant forms are known. The eyespots on the forewings most likely reduce bird attacks, so it is often seen resting with its wings open. Colonies vary in size depending on the available habitat, and can range from a few dozen to several thousand butterflies. This gatekeeper was photographed in  Botley  in  Oxfordshire , England.
