>Hibiscus moscheutos , commonly known by various names including rose mallow and swamp rose-mallow, is a species of flowering plant in the family  Malvaceae . It is a cold-hardy perennial  wetland  plant that can grow in large colonies. The hirsute leaves are of variable morphology, but are commonly deltoidal in shape with up to three lobes. It is found in wetlands and along the riverine systems of the eastern United States from Texas to the Atlantic states, its territory extending northward to southern  Ontario , Canada. It is a tall plant, with a height of 1.5 to 2.5 meters (4.9 to 8.2 ft) and flowers up to 20 centimeters (7.9 in) across. Petal colors range from pure white through various pinks to red, and most have an eye of deep maroon. These pink  H. moscheutos  flowers were photographed in  Point Pelee National Park  in Ontario.
