>A  lime  is a  citrus  fruit, which is typically round,  lime green  in colour, 3–6 centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) in diameter, and contains acidic  juice vesicles . There are several species of citrus trees whose fruits are called limes, including the  Key lime ,  Persian lime ,  kaffir lime ,  finger lime ,  blood lime , and  desert lime . Limes are a rich source of  vitamin C , are sour, and are often used to accent the flavours of foods and beverages. They are grown year-round, originally in tropical  South  and  Southeast Asia  but now in much of the world. Plants with fruit called "limes" have diverse genetic origins; limes do not form a  monophyletic  group. This photograph shows two limes grown in Brazil, one whole and one halved, and was  focus-stacked  from 23 images.
