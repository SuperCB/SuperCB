>Daft Punk  were a French  electronic music  duo formed in 1993 in Paris by  Thomas Bangalter  (left) and  Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo . They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the  French house  movement, combining  house music ,  funk ,  disco ,  techno ,  rock  and  synth-pop . They are regarded as one of the most influential acts in  dance music . From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities, and made few media appearances. In 2013, the band released their fourth and final album,  Random Access Memories , to acclaim. The lead single, " Get Lucky ", reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. The album won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including  Album of the Year  and  Record of the Year  for "Get Lucky".
