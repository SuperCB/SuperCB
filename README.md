>Kitt Peak National Observatory  is a United States  astronomical observatory  located on  Kitt Peak  in the  Quinlan Mountains , 55 miles (88 km) southwest of  Tucson, Arizona , in the  Sonoran Desert  and the  Tohono Oʼodham Nation . With more than twenty  optical telescopes  and two  radio telescopes , it is one of the largest gatherings of astronomical instruments in the Northern Hemisphere. The observatory was founded in 1958, and was administered by the  National Optical Astronomy Observatory  from the early 1980s until 2019, after which it has been overseen by  NOIRLab . This photograph, titled  A Breeze of Color , shows a portion of Kitt Peak National Observatory at sunset, and was taken as part of a 2022 photographic expedition to all the NOIRLab sites.
