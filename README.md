>Fred Sullivan  (1837–1877) was an English actor and singer. Born into a musical family, he trained as an architectural  draftsman  but abandoned the profession for a stage career. In 1871, he first performed the role of Mr. Cox in a revival of his brother  Arthur Sullivan 's comic opera  Cox and Box , and later that year created the role of Apollo in the first  Gilbert and Sullivan  opera,  Thespis . In 1875, he created his most famous role, the Learned Judge in Gilbert and Sullivan's  Trial by Jury , also playing in the accompanying Offenbach piece,  La Périchole . He earned enthusiastic reviews, and his portrayal of the Judge set the pattern for the subsequent Gilbert and Sullivan comic " patter " roles. He then toured in  Trial  and French  operettas , returning for the London revival of  Trial . Fred Sullivan died at the age of 39, leaving a pregnant widow and seven young children, his brother composing the song " The Lost Chord " at his bedside. This  sepia photograph  of Sullivan was taken by the Canadian photographer Olivier Sarony, probably in the 1870s.
