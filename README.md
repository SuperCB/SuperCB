>The  almond  ( Prunus amygdalus ) is a species of tree in the family  Rosaceae , the family named after roses. It prospers in a moderate  Mediterranean climate  with cool winter weather, and is native to  Iran  and surrounding countries, although it is rarely now found wild in its original setting. The fruit of the almond is a  drupe , consisting of an outer hull and a  hard shell  with the seed; botanically, it is not considered a  true nut . It is used extensively as a culinary  nut , however, and is cultivated worldwide. Around 80% of the world's almond supply is  produced in the US state of California . This photograph shows an almond drupe in shell, shell cracked open, unshelled and blanched seed.
