>Florence Price  (April 9, 1887 – June 3, 1953) was an American classical composer pianist, organist and music teacher. Born in  Little Rock, Arkansas , she was educated at the  New England Conservatory of Music  and was active in  Chicago  from 1927 until her death. Price was the first African-American woman to be recognized as a symphonic composer, and the first to have a composition played by a major  orchestra . She composed more than 300 works, including four  symphonies , four  concertos , as well as choral works,  art songs ,  chamber music , and music for solo instruments. This portrait photograph of Price was taken around 1940 by George Nelidoff and is in the collection of the  University of Arkansas Libraries .
