>The  splendid fairywren  ( Malurus splendens ) is a  passerine  bird in the  Australasian wren  family, Maluridae. It is found across much of the Australian continent from central-western  New South Wales  and southwestern  Queensland  over to coastal Western Australia. It inhabits predominantly arid and semi-arid regions. Exhibiting a high degree of  sexual dimorphism , the male in breeding plumage is a small, long-tailed bird of bright blue and black colouration. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. The species comprises several similar all-blue and black  subspecies  that were originally considered to be separate species. Like other fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings.  Male wrens pluck pink or purple petals and display them to females as part of a  courtship display . This male splendid fairywren was photographed in  Cargelligo State Forest  in New South Wales, Australia.
