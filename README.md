>Dendrelaphis punctulatus , also known as the Australian tree snake or the common tree snake, is a species of non-venomous snake in the family  Colubridae . The species is native to many parts of Australia, especially in the northern and eastern coastal areas, and to Papua New Guinea. It is found at altitudes from sea level to 500 metres (1,600 feet), in a variety of habitats including bushland, river banks, forests and rainforest edges, heathland and grassy areas, especially near water. It is an agile snake, with a very slender body and tail, and is also a strong swimmer, using the water for hunting and avoiding predation. Its  ventral  body colour varies from golden yellow, bright green or olive-green to black or sometimes even blue, while its back is typically dark in colour. In a study,  D. punctulatus  snakes had an average  snout–vent length  of 101 centimetres (40 inches), with males slightly shorter at 93 centimetres (37 inches). This  D. punctulatus  snake was photographed by the  Daintree River , near  Daintree  in rural northern  Queensland , Australia.
