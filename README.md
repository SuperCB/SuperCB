>Galaxea fascicularis  is a species of colonial  stony coral  in the family  Euphylliidae , commonly known as octopus coral, fluorescence grass coral, or galaxy coral. It is found in the  Red Sea , the  Gulf of Aden  and in large areas of the Indo-Pacific, on  coral-reef  slopes at depths between between 2 metres (6.6 ft) and 15 metres (49 ft). Small colonies of  G. fascicularis  often form low domes but as they grow, the  colonies  become more irregular, massively hummocky or columnar, and may eventually reach 5 metres (16 ft) across. The individual  polyps  are embedded in circular, tube-shaped  corallites  less than 1 centimetre (0.39 in) across, made of a limy material extruded by the polyps. Lining the corallites are a large number of ridge-like  septa  radiating from the centre. The polyps often feed in the daytime, and when their tentacles are extended the basic skeleton of the coral is hidden. The general colour of the coral ranges from green and grey to reddish brown. The tentacles are often a contrasting colour and are usually tipped with white. This  G. fascicularis  colony was photographed in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt.
