>The  Dewey Arch  was a  triumphal arch  in  Madison Square , New York City. It was erected for a parade on September 30, 1899, in honor of Admiral  George Dewey , to celebrate his victory at the  Battle of Manila Bay  in the Philippines the previous year. Constructed around two months before the parade, the arch was made of the plaster-based material  staff , typically used in temporary buildings. After the parade, the arch began to deteriorate and it was demolished in 1900 after an attempt to raise money to rebuild it in stone was unsuccessful. The arch's larger sculptures were sent to  Charleston, South Carolina , for an exhibit, after which they were either destroyed or lost.
