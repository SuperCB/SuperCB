>The Abduction of Europa  is a 1632  oil-on-panel painting  by  Rembrandt . One of his rare mythological works, it was inspired by Ovid's  Metamorphoses , part of which tells the tale of  Zeus 's seduction and capture of  Europa . The painting shows a coastal scene with Europa being carried away in rough waters by Zeus in the form of a bull while her friends remain on shore with expressions of horror. The use of an ancient myth to impart a contemporary thought and his portrayal of the scene using the  High Baroque  style are two strong aspects of the work. It was also influenced by  Titian 's  painting of the same subject  70 years earlier, although there are significant differences; Rembrandt's painting is less violent in nature than Titian's.  The Abduction of Europa  is now in the collection of the  J. Paul Getty Museum  in New York City.
