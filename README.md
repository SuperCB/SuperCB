>The Gross Clinic  is an 1875 oil-on-canvas painting by the American artist  Thomas Eakins . It measures 8 ft by 6.5 ft (240 cm by 200 cm). The painting depicts  Samuel D. Gross  (July 8, 1805 – May 6, 1884), a seventy-year-old American medical professor, dressed in a black frock coat and lecturing a group of  Jefferson Medical College  students in  Philadelphia , Pennsylvania. The painting is based on a surgery, witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for an infected  femur . Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation, as opposed to the  amputation  normally carried out at the time. Eakins included a self-portrait in the form of a student with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing, at the right-hand edge of the painting, next to the tunnel railing.  The Gross Clinic  has been restored  three times, most recently in 2010, and is currently in the collection of the  Philadelphia Museum of Art .
