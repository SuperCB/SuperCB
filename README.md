>The  Jadeite Cabbage , also known as  Jadeite Cabbage with Insects , is a piece of  jadeite  carved into the shape of a head of  Chinese cabbage , with a  locust  and a  katydid  camouflaged in the leaves. Created by an unknown sculptor in the 19th century, it was first displayed in the  Forbidden City 's Yonghe Palace, the residence of  Consort Jin , who probably received it as part of her dowry for her wedding to the  Guangxu Emperor  in 1889. The Jadeite Cabbage is now part of the collection of the  National Palace Museum  in  Taipei , Taiwan. It has been called the museum's "most famous masterpiece" and, along with the  Meat-Shaped Stone  and the  Mao Gong  ding , is considered one of the Three Treasures of the National Palace Museum.
