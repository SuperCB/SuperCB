>Nelly Martyl  (1 April 1884 – 9 November 1953) was a French opera singer based in Paris who participated in several world premieres. After making her professional debut in 1907 in Gluck's  Armide , she joined the  Opéra-Comique , where she appeared as Micaela in Bizet's  Carmen , Sophie in Massenet's  Werther , Mimi in Puccini's  La bohème  and in the title role of Massenet's  Manon , among others. During  World War I  and the  1918 flu epidemic , she worked as a nurse and received the  Croix de Guerre  for her service. After the war, she created a charitable medical foundation with automobile racer  Magdeleine Goüin . This photograph of Martyl was taken by the French photographer  Jean Reutlinger , probably between 1907 and 1912.
