>London King's Cross railway station  is a passenger railway terminus in the  London Borough of Camden , on the edge of  Central London . It is in the  London station group , one of the  busiest railway stations in the United Kingdom , and the southern terminus of the  East Coast Main Line  to  Yorkshire and the Humber ,  North East England  and  Scotland . The station was opened in  King's Cross  in 1852 by the  Great Northern Railway , and has been expanded and redeveloped several times since. This  panoramic photograph  shows the western departures concourse of King's Cross station, which was designed by  John McAslan  and opened in March 2012 as part of a major renovation project. McAslan said that the roof was the longest single-span station structure in Europe; the semi-circular structure has a radius of 59 yards (54 metres) and more than 2,000 triangular roof panels, half of which are glass.
