>Lightning  is a natural phenomenon formed by  electrostatic discharges  through the  atmosphere  between two  electrically charged  regions, either both in the atmosphere or one in the atmosphere and one on the ground, temporarily neutralizing these in a near-instantaneous release of an average of between 200  megajoules  and 7 gigajoules of energy, depending on the type. The three main types of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single  thundercloud  (intra-cloud), between two  clouds  (cloud-to-cloud), or between a cloud and the ground (cloud-to-ground), in which case it is referred to as a  lightning strike . Lightning causes  thunder , a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge heat suddenly to very high temperatures. It is often heard a few seconds after the lightning itself. Thunder is heard as a rolling, gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times. This photograph shows strokes of cloud-to-ground lightning hitting the Mediterranean Sea close to  Port-la-Nouvelle  in southern France.
