>William Utermohlen  (December 5, 1933 – March 21, 2007) was an American  figurative artist  who became known posthumously for his  self-portraits  created after his diagnosis of  Alzheimer's disease . He had developed progressive  memory loss  beginning about four years before his diagnosis in 1995. During that time, he began a series of self-portraits influenced in part by the figurative painter  Francis Bacon  and cinematographers from the movement of  German Expressionism . Utermohlen created this self-portrait with  mixed media  on paper in 1967.
