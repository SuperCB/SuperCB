>Danaus chrysippus , also known as the plain tiger or the African queen, belongs to the subfamily  Danainae  of the brush-footed butterfly family  Nymphalidae . Its range extends across Africa and the majority of the Asian continent, as well as many South Pacific islands and some populations in Australia. It is found in a wide variety of  habitats , although it is less likely to thrive in  jungle -like conditions and is most often found in drier, wide-open areas.  D. chrysippus  is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of about 7 to 8 centimetres (2.8 to 3.1 in). Its body is black with white spots, while the wings are a brownish orange, the upper side brighter and richer than the underside. It is a  polymorphic  species, so the exact coloring and patterning vary within and between populations. Its primary diet is milkweed plants, of the genus  Asclepias . Because of its  emetic  properties,  D. chrysippus  is  unpalatable  to most predators. As a result, its colouration is widely  mimicked  by other species of butterfly. This photograph shows the underside of a male butterfly of the subspecies  D. c. chrysippus , seen in  Kumarakom , India.
