>The  Survey of Palestine  was the government department responsible for the  survey and mapping of Palestine  during the period of British  Mandatory Palestine . The survey department was established in 1920 in  Jaffa , and moved to the outskirts of  Tel Aviv  in 1931. It established the  Palestine grid . In early 1948, the British mandate appointed a temporary director general of the Survey Department for the impending Jewish state; this became the  Survey of Israel . The maps produced by the survey have been widely used in "Palestinian refugee cartography" by scholars documenting the  1948 Palestinian exodus , notably in  Salman Abu Sitta 's  Atlas of Palestine  and  Walid Khalidi 's  All That Remains . This composite map of the  region of Palestine  was assembled from twenty-four separate 1:100,000 sheets published by the Survey for Palestine and its successor, the Survey of Israel, between 1942 and 1958.
