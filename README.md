>The  oroblanco  ( Citrus maxima  ×  C. paradisi ) is a sweet seedless  citrus hybrid  fruit. It was developed as a cross between a  diploid  acidless  pomelo  and a seedy white tetraploid  grapefruit , resulting in a triploid seedless fruit that is less acidic and less bitter than the grapefruit. The oroblanco was patented by the  University of California  in 1981 after its development at  the university's citrus experiment station  by  Robert Soost  and  James W. Cameron . Oroblancos are either round- or oval-shaped with a thicker rind than grapefruit. The fruit is available from September through December and can be peeled and eaten like an orange. A similar fruit named the "sweetie" has been commonly cultivated in Israel since 1984. This photograph shows oroblancos grown in Israel, one whole and one sectioned. The picture was  focus-stacked  from 12 separate images.
