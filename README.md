>The  Battle of Antietam , also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg, was a battle of the  American Civil War  fought on September 17, 1862, between Confederate general  Robert E. Lee 's  Army of Northern Virginia  and Union general  George B. McClellan 's  Army of the Potomac  near  Sharpsburg, Maryland , and  Antietam Creek . Part of the  Maryland campaign , it was the first  field army –level engagement in the  eastern theater of the American Civil War  to take place on Union soil. It remains the bloodiest day in American history, with a combined tally of 22,727 dead, wounded, or missing. Although the Union Army suffered heavier casualties than the Confederates, the battle was a major turning point in the Union's favor. This 1862 illustration by  Edwin Forbes  shows the charge across  Burnside's Bridge , which took place during the Battle of Antietam.
