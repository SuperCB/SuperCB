>Helena Hill Weed  (1875–1958) was an American  suffragist , and a member of the  National Woman's Party . The daughter of Connecticut congressman  Ebenezer Hill , she studied geology at  Vassar College  and the  Montana School of Mines  before joining the suffragist movement. In 1917, she became one of the first women to be arrested for picketing the  White House , having carried a banner stating "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed". She served three days in prison for this, and was apprehended again in January 1918 for applauding in court, for which she served a day in jail. In August of that year she was arrested for participating in the pro-suffrage Lafayette Square meeting at which her sister  Elsie Hill  spoke, for which Helena served fifteen days.
