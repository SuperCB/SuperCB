>Marie Antoinette and Her Children  is an  oil-on-canvas painting  by the French artist  Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun , painted in 1787. It shows  Marie Antoinette , the consort of  King Louis XVI of France , wearing a red velvet gown with a sable lining. Her younger son, the future  Louis XVII , sits on her lap, while her daughter  Marie-Thérèse  leans on her arm. Marie Antoinette's elder son,  Louis Joseph , at that time  Dauphin of France , is near an empty cradle intended for her younger daughter Sophie, who died before the painting's completion. The work was commissioned by Louis XVI in an effort to improve the public perception of Marie Antoinette, after her reputation was tarnished by the  Affair of the Diamond Necklace , by focusing on her role as a queen and a mother; she is depicted with little jewellery. The painting was first shown at the  Salon  in Paris, to mixed reactions, and is now displayed at the  Palace of Versailles .
