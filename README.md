>Rose O'Neill  (1874–1944) was an American  cartoonist , illustrator, artist, and writer. Raised in rural  Nebraska , she exhibited an interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of  Ladies' Home Journal , were later manufactured as  bisque ,   composition  and  celluloid  dolls. This  chromolithograph  by O'Neill, titled "When We All Believe", depicts many children gathered around  Santa Claus  and his bag of toys, and was published in the December 2, 1903, issue of  Puck .
