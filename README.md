>William Howard Taft  (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th  president of the United States , serving from 1909 to 1913, and the tenth  chief justice of the United States , serving from 1921 to 1930, the only person to have held both offices. Taft was elected president  in 1908 , the chosen successor of  Theodore Roosevelt , but was defeated for reelection  in 1912  by  Woodrow Wilson  after Roosevelt  split  the  Republican  vote by running as a  third-party  candidate. In 1921, President  Warren G. Harding  appointed Taft to be chief justice, a position he held until a month before his death. This photograph was taken in 1908 by the  Pach Brothers  studio.
