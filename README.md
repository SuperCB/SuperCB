>The  ArtScience Museum  is a building within the integrated resort of  Marina Bay Sands  in the  Downtown Core  of Singapore. Opened in 2011, it features exhibitions in art, science, culture and technology. The museum was designed by  Moshe Safdie  and features an exterior made of  fibre-reinforced plastic  supported internally by a steel lattice. It is anchored by a round base in the middle, with ten extensions referred to as "fingers" in the shape of a flower. This photograph shows the ArtScience Museum with other buildings of Singapore's Central Business District in the background.
