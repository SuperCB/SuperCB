>The  bala shark  ( Balantiocheilos melanopterus ) is a fish in the family  Cyprinidae , and one of two species in the genus  Balantiocheilos . It is found around the  Malay Peninsula ,  Sumatra , and  Borneo . It has a silver body with black margins on the  dorsal ,  caudal ,  anal , and  pelvic fins . It has big eyes which it uses to find and catch its prey. The bala shark has a maximum length of 35 cm (14 in). Bala sharks are found in midwater depths in large and medium-sized rivers and lakes. They feed on  phytoplankton , but mostly on small  crustaceans ,  rotifers , and  insects  and their  larvae . The bala shark is listed as a  vulnerable species  by the  IUCN Red List , having become rare or extinct in many river basins of its native range. However, large numbers of the species are bred in captivity and exported from Thailand for the  aquarium  trade. This bala shark was photographed at  Karlsruhe Zoo  in Karlsruhe, Germany.
