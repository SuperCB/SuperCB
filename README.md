>Batalha Monastery  is a  Dominican  convent in the municipality of  Batalha  in Portugal. Originally and officially known as the Monastery of Saint Mary of the Victory, it was erected in commemoration of the 1385  Battle of Aljubarrota  and would serve as the burial church of the 15th-century  Aviz dynasty  of Portuguese royalty. It is one of the best and original examples of Late  Flamboyant  Gothic architecture in Portugal, intermingled with the  Manueline  style. The monastery is a historic and cultural monument and was listed as a UNESCO  World Heritage Site  in 1983.  This photograph of the main facade of Batalha Monastery was taken in 2021.
