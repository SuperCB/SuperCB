>The  Mac  (known as the Macintosh until 1999) is a family of  personal computers  designed and marketed by  Apple Inc . The product lineup includes the  MacBook Air  and  MacBook Pro  laptops, and the  iMac ,  Mac Mini ,  Mac Studio , and  Mac Pro  desktops. Macs are sold with the  macOS  operating system, previously known as OS X. The Macintosh project was conceived by  Jef Raskin  in 1979 and then redefined in 1981 by Apple co-founder  Steve Jobs ,  the first model  being introduced in 1984 through  an advertisement  played during  Super Bowl XVIII . The product evolved with the introduction of color in 1987 with the  Macintosh II , and a new processor line in the  Power Macintosh  in 1994. Through most of the 1990s, the Mac was not fully competitive with commodity  IBM PC compatibles . Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 and subsequently returned the Mac to the mainstream with the launch of the  iMac  series OS X. Many users, especially professionals, felt that the Mac was neglected during the 2010s under CEO  Tim Cook , but  a new line of Macs  with the  Apple silicon  chipset has received more positive reviews. This photograph shows Jobs with the first Mac, at the time of its launch on January 24, 1984. The image on the computer screen is a digitized version of  A Woman Combing Her Hair , a print by the Japanese artist  Goyō Hashiguchi .
