>Winston Churchill  (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman, soldier and writer who served as  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  from 1940 to 1945,  during the Second World War , and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from 1922 to 1924, he was a  member of Parliament  from 1900 to 1964, representing five different  constituencies . This black-and-white photograph of Churchill, titled  The Roaring Lion , was taken on 30 December 1941 by the Armenian-Canadian photographer  Yousuf Karsh  in the  Centre Block  on  Parliament Hill  in  Ottawa , Canada. The photograph is particularly noted for Churchill's posture and facial expression, which have been compared to the wartime feelings that prevailed in the United Kingdom – persistence in the face of an all-conquering enemy.
