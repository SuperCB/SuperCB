>The  Chandos portrait  is the most famous of the  portraits that are believed to depict   William Shakespeare  ( c.  23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616). Painted between 1600 and 1610, it may have served as the basis for the engraved portrait of Shakespeare used in his  First Folio  in 1623.  John Taylor  ( c.  1580–1653) is thought by several scholars to have painted the portrait. It is named for the  3rd Duke of Chandos , who formerly owned the painting. The portrait was given to the  National Portrait Gallery, London , on its foundation in 1856, and it is listed as the first work in its collection.
