>The  Crucifixion with the Virgin and St John  is an oil painting by the Dutch artist  Hendrick ter Brugghen , probably painted around 1625 as an  altarpiece  for a Catholic  clandestine church  likely located in  Utrecht  in the  Calvinist  Dutch  United Provinces . The scene is taken from the account of the  crucifixion of Jesus  in the  Gospel of John , and depicts Jesus being mourned by his mother  Mary  and  John the Apostle . At the base of the cross are bones, traditionally identified as those of  Adam . The scene is set in an atmosphere of deep dusk with stars visible in the background. The painting was not known until it was discovered in a bombed-out church in  South Hackney , London, in 1956. Initially unrecognized, it was identified before an appearance at  Sotheby's  later that year. It was acquired by the  Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York, where it now hangs.
