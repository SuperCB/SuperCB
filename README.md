>Sándor Vay  (1859–1918) was a Hungarian poet and journalist. Born as a female named Sarolta, Vay was one of the first Hungarian women to complete university studies. Vay then began identifying as a male journalist, both before and after the sensational trial for his marriage to another woman in 1889. The case drew the attention of noted  sexologists  of the period, including  Havelock Ellis  and  Richard von Krafft-Ebing , who used it to explore  female inversion  in the emerging field of  sexology . During his lifetime, he was well respected as an author of historical articles on notable figures and cultural topics related to Hungary. Many of his works have been posthumously republished and are considered an important part of his country's literary heritage.
