>Polistes gallicus  is a species of  paper wasp  found in a region from the Alps south into northwest Africa and east to Croatia and Corfu. It can live in a range of temperatures including warmer climates and cooler regions north of the Alps, with nests created in these various conditions.  A  social  insect, the species uses an oral secretion to construct its nests, which consist of a combination of saliva and chewed plant fibers. This structural mixture physically protects the nest from various harsh elements and from weathering over time. Like other members of the subgenus  Polistes ,  P. gallicus  has recognizable bright yellow and black markings. It has a smaller body than many others from the genus that overlap in range. This  P. gallicus  individual was photographed in Bavaria, Germany.
