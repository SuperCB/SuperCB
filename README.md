>Wheelwright  is a city in the U.S. state of  Kentucky . Located at the southern end of  Floyd County , the land that would later become the city was originally owned by the Hall family. In 1916, the family sold their land to the Elk Horn Coal Company, which established a post office and named it Wheelwright in honor of its president, Jere Wheelwright. It was incorporated as a city in 1917. The Elk Horn Coal Company founded the city as a  company town , and built houses, stores, churches, schools, and hospitals, which were used by miners employed by the company. In 1930, Wheelwright was sold to the  Inland Steel Company , which in turn sold the city to the Island Creek Coal Company in 1966. In the 1970s, the mine closed and the city was purchased by the  Kentucky Housing Corporation . This 1946 photograph, taken by the American photographer  Russell Lee , shows Harry Fain, a coal loader from Wheelwright who worked for the Inland Steel Company. The photograph is in the collection of the  National Archives and Records Administration .
