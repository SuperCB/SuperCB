>Apollo 15  (July 26 – August 7, 1971) was the fourth crewed mission to  land on the Moon . It was the first of three  J missions , with a longer stay on the  Moon , a greater focus on science, and the use of the first  Lunar Roving Vehicle  (LRV).  David Scott  and  James Irwin  landed near  Hadley Rille  and spent 18 and a half hours on  extravehicular activity  (EVA), collecting 170 pounds (77 kg) of surface material. During the return trip,  Alfred Worden  performed the first spacewalk in deep space. The mission included the collection of the  Genesis Rock , thought to be part of the Moon's early  crust , and Scott used a hammer and a feather to demonstrate  Galileo's theory  that, absent air resistance, objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass. The mission was later marred when it was found that  the crew had carried unauthorized postal covers to the lunar surface , some of which were sold by a West German stamp dealer. The crew was reprimanded for poor judgment, and none flew in space again. This photograph, taken by Scott during an EVA on August 2, shows Irwin giving a military salute beside the U.S. flag. The  Lunar Module   Falcon  is in the center, with the LRV on the right.
