>La Wally  is an  opera  in four acts by composer  Alfredo Catalani , to a  libretto  by  Luigi Illica , first performed at  La Scala , Milan, in 1892. The story is set in the Austrian  Tyrol  where the heroine Wally is in love with Giuseppe Hagenbach. However, her father, Stromminger, wants her to marry Vincenzo Gellner. The opera concludes with Hagenbach and Wally pledging their love for each other, but being killed by an avalanche.  La Wally  was Catalani's last opera. This 1892 illustration by  Adolfo Hohenstein  depicts the Act I costume design for the title character Wally.
