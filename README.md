>The  Australian white ibis  ( Threskiornis molucca ) is a wading  bird  of the  ibis  family,  Threskiornithidae . It is widespread across much of Australia, and has a predominantly white plumage with a bare, black head, long downcurved bill, and black legs. While it is closely related to the  African sacred ibis , the Australian white ibis is a  native Australian bird . Due to its increasing presence in the urban environment and its habit of rummaging in garbage, the species has acquired a variety of colloquial names such as "tip turkey" and "bin chicken". This Australian white ibis was photographed at the  Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney .
