>The  flame-faced tanager  ( Tangara parzudakii ) is a species of bird in the  tanager  family, Thraupidae. It is  endemic  to South America and is found in the eastern  Andes  of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, its natural habitat being subtropical or tropical moist  montane forests . The flame-faced tanager is a distinctive-looking species with black and  opalescent -green upperparts, opalescent-green and buff underparts, and a deep-red and yellow face. The subspecies  T. p. lunigera  lacks the deep red on the face, which is replaced with orangish-red. It is an omnivorous bird, feeding on fruit and  arthropods  found mostly on mossy branches. It breeds in the rainy season with eggs laid in  clutches  of two and  fledglings  fed by both parents. Although it is listed as a  least-concern species  by the  International Union for Conservation of Nature , it is facing population decline due to  habitat destruction . This flame-faced tanager of the subspecies  T. p. parzudakii  was photographed perching on a branch in the Parque Verde y Agua in Colombia's  Cundinamarca Department .
