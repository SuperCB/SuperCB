>Leonhard Euler  (1707–1783) was a Swiss  mathematician  and  physicist . He developed important concepts and proved mathematical  theorems  in fields as diverse as  calculus ,  number theory  and  topology . Euler introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for  mathematical analysis , such as the notion of a  mathematical function . He is also renowned for his work in  mechanics ,  optics  and  astronomy . Euler is considered to be the preeminent mathematician of the 18th century and one of the greatest of all time. He was prolific; if printed, his works would occupy between 60 and 80  quarto  volumes. Euler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss ten- franc  banknote and on numerous Swiss, German and Russian stamps. The asteroid  2002 Euler  was named in his honor. This portrait of Euler was created by the Swiss painter  Jakob Emanuel Handmann  in 1753 and is now in the collection of the  Kunstmuseum Basel .
