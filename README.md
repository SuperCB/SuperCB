>Rani ki Vav  is a  stepwell  situated in the town of  Patan  in  Gujarat , India. It is located on the banks of the  Saraswati River . Its construction is attributed to Udayamati, the spouse of the 11th-century  Chaulukya  king  Bhima I . Silted over, it was rediscovered in the 1940s and restored in the 1980s by the  Archaeological Survey of India . It has been listed as one of the UNESCO  World Heritage Sites in India  since 2014. One of the largest examples of its kind, this stepwell is designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water. It is divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural panels. These panels have more than five hundred principal sculptures and more than one thousand minor ones that combine religious and symbolic imagery.
