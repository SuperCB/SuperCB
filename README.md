>Kourion  is an ancient city-state on the southwestern coast of the island of Cyprus, located near modern  Limassol , that existed from antiquity until the Middle Ages. Built in the 12th century BC by  Mycenaeans  who took part in the  Trojan War , Kourion was later controlled by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. The settlement was placed on a 70-metre-high (230 ft) cliff to ensure the safety of its citizens. The modern archaeological site is managed by the  Department of Antiquities  of Cyprus and includes the ruins of the stadium and the sanctuary of  Apollo Hylates . This photograph depicts the ruins of Kourion's  agora , a central public space in the city-state.
