>The  citric acid cycle , also known as the TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) or the Krebs cycle, is a series of  chemical reactions  to release stored energy through the  oxidation  of  acetyl-CoA  derived from  carbohydrates ,  fats , and  proteins . In addition, the cycle provides  precursors  of certain  amino acids , as well as  NADH , a  reducing agent , which are used in numerous other reactions. Its central importance to many  biochemical pathways  suggests that it was one of the earliest components of  metabolism  and may have originated  abiogenically . The German-born British biochemist  Hans Krebs  received the 1953  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  for his identification of the cycle in 1937. The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from  citric acid , which is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of  acetyl-CoA ) and  water , and reduces NAD +  to NADH, releasing carbon dioxide. The NADH generated by the cycle is fed into the  oxidative phosphorylation  (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of  nutrients  to produce usable chemical energy in the form of  adenosine triphosphate . These processes are depicted in this overview diagram of the citric acid cycle.
