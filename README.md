>Wilson Square  is an urban square and roundabout, located in the  Żoliborz  area of Warsaw, Poland. Constructed in around 1923, close to Sokolnicki Fort, part of the  Warsaw Citadel , the square was designed by Józef Jankowski, Antoni Jawornicki, and Tadeusz Tołwiński. Initially named after Polish novelist  Stefan Żeromski , the square was renamed in 1926 in honour of the recently-deceased US president  Woodrow Wilson . The buildings around the square were partially destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and it was remodelled in 1955. The modern square features a lawn and greenery with a road running through it, as well as  tram tracks  and the  Plac Wilsona metro station . This photograph shows an aerial view of Wilson Square from the south-east.
