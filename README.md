>Hazel MacKaye  (1880–1944) was an American theater professional and suffragist. She is best known for helping present a series of pageants in support of  women's suffrage . The organizers of the  Woman Suffrage Procession , planned for March 3, 1913 (just prior to  President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration ), in Washington, D.C., asked MacKaye to create a pageant for the event. Titled  Allegory  and produced by  Glenna Smith Tinnin , it was presented on the steps of the  Treasury Building  as the culmination of the event. The pageant was praised as "one of the most impressively beautiful spectacles ever staged in this country" in  The New York Times . This photograph of MacKaye holding a dog was taken in 1915 by the photographic studio  Harris & Ewing .
