>The  crested caracara  ( Caracara plancus ), also known as the Mexican eagle, is a  bird of prey  in the family  Falconidae . It is found throughout Central and South America, with a maximum range extending north to  Minnesota  and south to  Tierra del Fuego . A bold, opportunistic raptor, it is often seen walking around on the ground looking for food. It mainly feeds on the carcasses of dead animals, but steals food from other raptors, raids bird and reptile nests, and takes live prey if the possibility arises. This adult crested caracara was photographed in the  Serra da Canastra National Park , Brazil.
