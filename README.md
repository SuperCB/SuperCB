>The  green kingfisher  ( Chloroceryle americana ) is a species of bird in the  kingfisher  family, Alcedinidae. It is found from the southern United States, south through Central America, and in every mainland South American country except Chile. The green kingfisher is about 20 cm (7.9 in) long and weighs about 35 to 40 g (1.2 to 1.4 oz), with females being larger and heavier than males. It has various vocalisations, including one described as resembling "the striking of two pebbles together" and another as "a harsh, buzzy scold". This male green kingfisher, a member of the subspecies  C. a. americana , was spotted close to the  Cristalino River  in the  Pantanal , Brazil.
