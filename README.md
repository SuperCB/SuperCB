>Atacamite  is a copper  halide mineral : a  copper(II) chloride hydroxide  with the chemical formula Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3 . It was first described in 1802 by  Dmitri Alekseyevich Golitsyn  from deposits in Chile's  Atacama Desert , after which it is named. Atacamite is a comparatively rare mineral, formed from primary copper minerals in the  oxidation  or  weathering  zone of arid climates. It has also been reported as a  volcanic sublimate  from  fumarole  deposits, as sulfide alteration products in  black smokers . This photograph shows a specimen of atacamite, on a  malachite  matrix, from the Mount Gunson Mines in  South Australia . The picture was  focus-stacked  from 42 separate images.
