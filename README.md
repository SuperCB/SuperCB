>The  Orchid Pavilion Gathering , also known as the Lanting Gathering, was a cultural and poetic event held in China in 353, during the  Jin dynasty  of the  Six Dynasties  era. During the  Spring Purification Festival , forty-two literati met at the Orchid Pavilion ( Lanting ) on  Mount Kuaiji , near present-day  Shaoxing  in  Zhejiang . This 7th-century scroll, now at the  Palace Museum  in Beijing, is considered to be the best of the surviving copies of the  Lantingji Xu , written by  Wang Xizhi  as a preface to the collection of poems produced at the Orchid Pavilion Gathering. Copies of the work were made throughout Chinese history. The text reads, in part: "Reading past compositions, I can recognize the same melancholy from the ancients. I can only lament before their words without being able to verbalize my feelings. [...] The future generations will look upon us, just like we look upon our past. How sad! Hence, we record the people presented here today and their works; Even though time and circumstances will be different, the feelings expressed will remain unchanged."
