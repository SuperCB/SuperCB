>The  Mediterranean moray  ( Muraena helena ), also known as the Roman eel, is a species of fish in the family Muraenidae, the  moray eels . It has a long eel-like body and is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The species prefers rocky bottoms and lives at depths between 1 and 800 metres (3 and 2,620 ft), with the 100–300-metre (330–980 ft) range being the most common habitat. It is a territorial species and is more active at night, spending most of the day in cavities and clefts between rocks. It hunts fish, crabs and  cephalopods , and its bite can be dangerous to humans. This Mediterranean moray was photographed off the coast of the Maltese island of  Gozo .
