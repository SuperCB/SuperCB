>The  mortuary temple of Hatshepsut  is a  mortuary temple  built during the reign of  Hatshepsut , a pharaoh of the  Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt , around the 15th century BC. Located opposite the city of  Luxor , the temple's three terraces rise above the desert floor and into the cliffs of  Deir el-Bahari .  Hatshepsut's tomb  lies inside the same massif, capped by  El Qurn , a pyramid for her mortuary complex. At the edge of the desert, one kilometre (0.6 miles) east, connected to the complex by a causeway lies the accompanying valley temple. Across the river  Nile , the whole structure points towards the monumental Eighth Pylon, Hatshepsut's most recognizable addition to the temple of  Karnak . The temple's twin functions are identified by its axes: its main east–west axis served to receive the  barque  of  Amun-Re  at the climax of the festival, while its north–south axis represented the life cycle of the pharaoh from coronation to rebirth. This aerial photograph shows the reconstructed mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, viewed from the southeast.
