>The Cenotaph  is a war memorial on  Whitehall  in London, England. Designed by  Sir Edwin Lutyens , it was unveiled on 11 November 1920 as the United Kingdom's national memorial to the British and  Commonwealth  dead of the  First World War . It was rededicated in 1946 to also commemorate those who had fallen in the  Second World War , and has since come to represent British casualties from later conflicts. The word  cenotaph  is derived from Greek, meaning 'empty tomb'; the monument symbolises the absence of the dead and is a focal point for public mourning. The original temporary Cenotaph was erected in 1919 for a parade celebrating the end of the First World War; calls for it to be rebuilt in permanent form began almost immediately. The permanent Cenotaph was unveiled by  George V  on 11 November 1920 in a ceremony combined with the repatriation of  the Unknown Warrior . The  National Service of Remembrance  is held annually at the site on  Remembrance Sunday . This sketch by Lutyens of the Cenotaph's front and end elevations was published in  The Illustrated London News  two days after it was unveiled.
