>The  Finding in the Temple , also called Christ among the Doctors, the Disputation in the Temple and variations of those names, is an episode in the early life of  Jesus  depicted in  chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke . It is the only event of the later childhood of Jesus mentioned in a  canonical gospel . In the episode, Jesus – at the age of twelve – accompanies  Mary ,  Joseph , and a large group of their relatives and friends to  Jerusalem  on many pilgrimages. On the day of their return, Jesus remained in  the Temple . Mary and Joseph returned home believing he was among their group when he was not. After a day of travel they realised Jesus was missing and returned to Jerusalem, finding him three days later. He was found in the Temple in discussion with the elders, "listening to them and asking them questions". When admonished by Mary, Jesus replied: "How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?" The Finding in the Temple is frequently shown in art. This representation, titled  The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple , is an  oil-on-canvas painting  produced by  William Holman Hunt  in 1860. It now hangs in the  Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery  in Birmingham, England.
