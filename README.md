>The  springbok  ( Antidorcas marsupialis ) is a medium-sized  antelope  found mainly in the dry areas of southern and southwestern Africa. A slender, long-legged  bovid , it reaches 71 to 86 cm (28 to 34 in) at the shoulder and weighs between 27 and 42 kg (60 and 93 lb). Both sexes have a pair of long black  horns  that curve backwards, a white face, a dark stripe running from the eyes to the mouth, a light-brown  coat  with a reddish-brown stripe, and a white  rump  flap. Primarily  browsing  at dawn and dusk, it can live without drinking water for years, subsisting on  succulent vegetation . Breeding peaks in the rainy season, when food is more  abundant. A single calf is weaned at nearly six months of age and leaves its mother a few months later. Springbok herds in the  Kalahari Desert  and the semi-arid  Karoo  used to migrate in large numbers across the countryside.  The springbok is the national animal of South Africa. This male springbok was photographed in  Etosha National Park , Namibia.
