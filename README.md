>Ernest Rutherford  (1871–1937) was a New Zealand physicist who was a pioneering researcher in both  atomic  and  nuclear physics . In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive  half-life , the radioactive element  radon , and differentiated and named  alpha  and  beta radiation . This work formed the basis for a  Nobel Prize in Chemistry , awarded in 1908. With  Thomas Royds , Rutherford developed the theory that alpha radiation is  helium  nuclei, and also theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small  nucleus , and thereby pioneered the  Rutherford model  of the  atom . He went on to perform the first artificially induced  nuclear reaction  in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which became known as the  proton . Rutherford spent his later years as director of the  Cavendish Laboratory  in Cambridge. The chemical element  rutherfordium  was named after him in 1997. This photograph of Rutherford, published by the  Bain News Service , was most likely taken in the 1920s.
