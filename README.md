>Catherine Grand  (1761–1835) was a French courtesan and noblewoman. Born in India as the daughter of a  French East India Company  officer, she married George Grand, an officer of the  English East India Company . After her marriage, she had a scandalous liaison with Bengal councillor  Philip Francis  in  Calcutta . Her husband sent her to Paris, where she became a popular  courtesan , having relationships with several powerful men, and was known as Madame Grand. She became the mistress and later the wife of French diplomat  Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord , the first  prime minister of France . This 1783  oil-on-canvas  portrait of Grand was painted by  Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun . It was exhibited at the  Salon  of the Royal Academy in Paris the same year, as one of at least ten portraits submitted by Le Brun, and was favourably received. The painting is now in the collection of the  Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York.
