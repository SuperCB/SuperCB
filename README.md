>Thyroid hormones  are  hormones  produced and released by the  thyroid gland , namely  triiodothyronine  (T 3 ) and thyroxine (T 4 ). They are  tyrosine -based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of  metabolism . T 3  and T 4  are partially composed of  iodine , derived from food. A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T 3  and T 4 , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as  simple goitre . This illustration shows the synthesis of thyroid hormones, as seen on an individual  thyroid follicular cell .
