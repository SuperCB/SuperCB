>Holothuria fuscogilva , also known as the white teatfish, is a species of  sea cucumber  in the family  Holothuriidae . It is found in the tropical waters of the  Indo-Pacific  in shallow waters near islands and around coral reefs. Juveniles live in shallower waters (such as inter-tidal zones) and then migrate to deeper waters as they mature. Adults of this species weigh between 2.4 and 4 kilograms (5.3 and 8.8 pounds) and are elliptical in shape with a firm texture. They feature lateral papillae (teats), which are often buried in the sand. The species is consumed as food and is vulnerable to over-exploitation from commercial fishing. This  H. fuscogilva  sea cucumber was photographed in  Ras Muhammad National Park  off the  Red Sea  coast of the  Sinai Peninsula  in Egypt.
