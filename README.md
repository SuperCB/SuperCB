>A  field ration  is a type of prepackaged  military ration  designed to be easily and quickly prepared and consumed on the battlefield, in combat, at the  front line , or where eating facilities are otherwise unavailable. Field rations are primarily used by military forces, though they are also sometimes distributed to civilians as part of  humanitarian aid  and  emergency management . They consist principally of dried and nonperishable foods, including among others  preserved and nonperishable  precooked meat, vegetables, grains and rice, dehydrated soup, side dishes, desserts and drinks. They took their modern form from the 19th century onwards, with the invention of airtight food preservation, canned food, and  pasteurization . Field rations are designed with a long shelf life and can be eaten at any temperature, but they are heated or cooked where possible. This photograph shows the arranged contents of an  Einmannpackung Typ 1  field ration issued to the German  Bundeswehr  in 1974, on display at the  Museum of Hamburg History  in Hamburg, Germany. It includes, from left to right and top to bottom: an instant-rice ready meal, scrambled eggs with ham and spaghetti,  hardtack , a condiment, semi-sweet chocolate, and coffee creamer;  liverwurst , strawberry jam, melted cheese, four water-purification tablets, and salt; tea-extract powder, a damp towel, coffee extract, orange drink powder, a  matchbook , refined sugar, and spearmint chewing gum.
