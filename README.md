>Cox and Box , also known as  The Long-Lost Brothers , is a one-act  comic opera  with a libretto by  F. C. Burnand  and music by  Arthur Sullivan , based on the 1847 farce  Box and Cox  by  John Maddison Morton . It premiered in 1866 and was Sullivan's first successful comic opera. The story concerns a landlord who lets a room to two lodgers, one who works at night and one who works during the day. When one of them has the day off, they meet each other in the room and tempers flare. Sullivan wrote this piece five years before  Thespis , his first opera with  W. S. Gilbert . This poster was produced for the first professional production of  Cox and Box , which began in 1869 at the  Royal Gallery of Illustration  in London and ran for 264 performances there. The opera has frequently been used as a  curtain raiser  for the shorter  Gilbert and Sullivan  operas and continues to be frequently produced.
