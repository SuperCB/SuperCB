>Heliconius charithonia , commonly known as the zebra longwing or zebra heliconian, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family  Nymphalidae . It is distributed across South and Central America and the U.S. states of Texas and Florida, with some migrations further north in the warmer months. Adult butterflies are  monomorphic  of medium size with long wings. On the  dorsal  side, the wings are black with narrow white and yellow stripes, with a similar pattern on the  ventral  side, but paler and with red spots. The wingspan ranges from 72 to 100 mm (2.8 to 3.9 in). The  caterpillars  are white with black spots and have numerous black spikes along their body. Adults roost in groups of up to 60 individuals on a nightly basis, returning to the same roost every night. These roosts provide protection to adults, the large groups deterring predators and retaining warmth. This  H. charithonia  butterfly was photographed in  Hendry County, Florida .
