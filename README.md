>The  1990 Nepalese revolution  was a multi-party movement that brought an end to  absolute monarchy  and the beginning of  constitutional monarchy , eliminating the  panchayat  system in Nepal. The revolution began in February 1990 following an alliance between two opposition groups: the  Nepali Congress  and the  United Left Front . In the subsequent weeks, the movement became increasingly large and dangerous as thousands of students marched against riot police and hundreds were arrested and injured. The movement called for  bandhs  (a kind of  general strike ) that quickly spread across the country. In early April, 200,000 people marched to  Kathmandu  in protest of the monarchy. Over the course of several days, police shot and killed dozens as protesters demanded a restoration of the 1950s-era multiparty democracy system. Protesters surrounded government buildings, and  King Birendra  eventually removed the ban on political parties on 8 April, ending the revolution. This photograph, taken on 9 April, shows Durga Thapa, a Nepali student, leaping in the air while displaying a double  victory sign  amidst a large crowd in  Asan , Kathmandu.
