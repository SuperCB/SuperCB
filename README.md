>The  spotted dove  ( Spilopelia chinensis ) is a small and somewhat long-tailed bird of the pigeon family,  Columbidae , that is a common resident breeding bird across its native range on the  Indian subcontinent  and in  Southeast Asia . The species has been introduced to many parts of the world and  feral  populations have become established. There are considerable plumage variations across populations within its wide range; for example the populations in India and Sri Lanka are long tailed and buff brown in colour with a white-spotted black collar patch on the back and sides of the neck. This spotted dove was photographed in  Kanha National Park , Madhya Pradesh, India.
