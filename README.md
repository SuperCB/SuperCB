>Marian Anderson  (1897–1993) was an American  contralto . She performed a wide range of music, from  opera  to  spirituals , in major concert and recital venues between 1925 and 1965. Anderson was an important figure in the struggle for African-American artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, after being prohibited from performing for an integrated audience in  Constitution Hall  in Washington, D.C., First Lady  Eleanor Roosevelt  and her husband President  Franklin D. Roosevelt  arranged for Anderson to perform an open-air concert on  Easter Sunday  on the  Lincoln Memorial  steps in the capital which was broadcast to a radio audience of millions and was featured in a  documentary film . In 1955, Anderson became the first African-American singer to perform at the  Metropolitan Opera . She worked as a delegate to the  United Nations Human Rights Committee  and as a Goodwill Ambassador for the  United States Department of State , giving concerts all over the world. She participated in the  civil rights movement  in the 1960s, singing at the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom  in 1963. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Anderson was awarded the first  Presidential Medal of Freedom  in 1963, the  Congressional Gold Medal  in 1977, the  Kennedy Center Honors  in 1978, the  National Medal of Arts  in 1986, and a  Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award  in 1991.
