>Wheat Fields  is a series of dozens of paintings by Dutch artist  Vincent van Gogh . The close association of peasants and the cycles of nature particularly interested Van Gogh, such as the sowing of seeds, harvest and sheaves of wheat in the fields. Van Gogh saw ploughing, sowing and harvesting as symbolic to man's efforts to overwhelm the cycles of nature. This oil-on-canvas  Wheat Fields  painting, also sometimes known as  Wheat Field with Alpilles Foothills in the Background , was created in June 1888 and is now in the  Van Gogh Museum  in Amsterdam.
