>The  common buzzard  ( Buteo buteo ) is a  bird of prey  in the family  Accipitridae . The species lives in most of Europe and extends its breeding range across much of the  Palearctic  as far as northwestern China (the  Tian Shan ), far  western Siberia , and northwestern Mongolia. It is a year-round resident over much of its range. However, buzzards from the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere as well as those that breed in the eastern part of their range typically migrate south for the northern winter, many journeying as far as South Africa. The common buzzard is an opportunistic predator that can take a wide variety of prey, but it feeds mostly on small mammals, especially rodents such as  voles . It typically hunts from a perch. Like most accipitrid birds of prey, the common buzzard builds a nest and has a relatively small brood of young. It appears to be the most common diurnal raptor in Europe; estimates of its total global population run well into the millions. This steppe buzzard (of the subspecies  B. b. vulpinus ) was photographed in  Etosha National Park , Namibia.
