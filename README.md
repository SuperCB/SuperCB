>Spiti  is a high-altitude  cold desert  in the  Western Himalayas  in India.  "Spiti" means "the middle land", between  Tibet  and India. The region is above the  tree line , with only shrubs and a few scattered stunted trees. In the upper valley, the braided Spiti River flows in narrow channels in a very wide river bed, as seen in this photograph, taken just above  Kaza , the largest town in Spiti. In the lower valley, the river meanders through gorges 10 to 130 metres (33 to 427 ft) deep that it has cut in the  sedimentary  deposits. The Moravian geologist  Ferdinand Stoliczka  discovered a major geological formation near the village of  Mud  in the 1860s, and identified a number of layers or successions. The people of Spiti follow  Tibetan Buddhism , and their culture is similar to those of neighbouring Tibet and Ladakh. The region is known for adventure tourism, trekking and mountaineering.
