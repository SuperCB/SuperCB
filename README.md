>The  long-crested eagle  ( Lophaetus occipitalis ) is an African  bird of prey . Like all  eagles , it is in the family  Accipitridae . It is characterised by the feathers making up the shaggy crest. It is found throughout mid- to southern-Africa with differing home ranges due to food availability and suitable habitat area but lives mainly on forest edges and near moist areas. Breeding usually occurs year-round depending on food availability with 1 to 2 eggs being laid as is characteristic by raptors. Furthermore, as a raptor species, it commonly eats smaller mammals, however other vertebrates and invertebrates are also consumed. This long-crested eagle was photographed in  Queen Elizabeth National Park , Uganda.
