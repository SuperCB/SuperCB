>La Esmeralda  is a  grand opera  in four acts composed by  Louise Bertin , with a French-language  libretto  written by  Victor Hugo , who adapted it from his 1831 novel  The Hunchback of Notre-Dame . The opera premiered at the  Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique  in Paris on 14 November 1836, with  Cornélie Falcon  in the title role. There was some disruption at the premiere, as members of the audience who disliked the Bertin family shouted out that the work had been written by Berlioz, an accusation which Berlioz himself denied.  La Esmeralda  proved to be the last opera composed by Bertin although she lived for another 40 years. This drawing is  Charles-Antoine Cambon 's  set design  for act 3, scene 1, of  La Esmeralda , in which Phoebus meets with Esmeralda, and Frollo spies on them and eventually stabs Phoebus with his sword.
