>The Colonel  is a  farce  in three acts by  F. C. Burnand , premiered in 1881, based on Jean François Bayard's 1844 play  Le mari à la campagne . The story concerns the efforts of two  aesthetic  impostors to gain control of a family fortune by converting a man's wife and mother-in-law to follow aestheticism. The man is so unhappy that he seeks the company of a widow in town. His friend, an American colonel, intervenes to persuade the wife to return to conventional behavior and obey her husband to restore domestic harmony, and the colonel marries the widow himself.  The Colonel 's  initial run was at the  Prince of Wales's Theatre , for 550 performances, while simultaneously a second company was touring the British provinces with the play. In October 1881, it received a  command performance  before  Queen Victoria , the first play to do so since the death of  Prince Albert  in 1861. It transferred to the  Imperial Theatre  in 1883 and then to the new  Prince of Wales Theatre  in 1884. In July 1887, there was a revival at the  Comedy Theatre . This  cabinet card  depicts Rowland Buckstone as Basil Giorgione (left) and Cissy Grahame as Nellie Forrester (right) reprising their roles in the 1887 revival of  The Colonel . The  sepia photographic print  measures 14.6 cm × 9.9 cm (5.7 in × 3.9 in) and is in the collection of the  Victoria and Albert Museum .
