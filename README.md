>The  Divje Babe flute , also sometimes called the tidldibab or Neanderthal flute, is the  femur  of a  cave bear , which is pierced by spaced holes similar to those found on a  flute . The object was unearthed at  Divje Babe I , a cave site near  Cerkno  in northwestern Slovenia in 1995, during systematic archaeological excavations in the area. It is possible that it was made by  Neanderthals  as a form of  musical instrument , although this theory is debated by scientists: some argue that the holes in the bone were artificially made by Neanderthals, while others say they were made by  carnivores . If confirmed as a musical instrument, it would be the oldest-known  Paleolithic flute  and musical instrument. The object is now in the collection of the  National Museum of Slovenia  in  Ljubljana .
