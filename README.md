>The  Alpine ibex  ( Capra ibex ), also known as the steinbock, is a species of  goat  that lives in the  Alps  of Europe. Its closest living relative is the  Iberian ibex . Alpine ibex have brownish-grey  coats  and sharp hooves adapted to steep, rough terrain. Found at elevations as high as 3,300 metres (10,800 feet), they are active throughout the year, primarily feeding on grass in open alpine meadows. Adult males, which are larger than females, segregate from them for most of the year, coming together only during the breeding season, when they fight for access to the females using their long horns. The Alpine ibex has been successfully reintroduced to parts of its historical range, but all individuals living today descend from a  population bottleneck  of fewer than 100 individuals from  Gran Paradiso National Park  in Italy. The species has few predators and is not  threatened , but it has very low  genetic diversity . These Alpine ibex, a male in winter and a female in summer, were photographed at  Creux du Van  in Switzerland.
