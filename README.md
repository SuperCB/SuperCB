>The  cattle tyrant  ( Machetornis rixosa ) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the  tyrant flycatcher . It has a  disjunct distribution , consisting of one race in a region from northern Argentina and Bolivia to the north-eastern tip of Brazil, and the two other subspecies ranging from Panama to Venezuela and eastern Ecuador. It inhabits drier open and semi-open habitats, and avoided forested and wooded areas. It can be found in savannah, pastureland, parkland, agricultural land and even gardens. The  capybara  ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ) is the largest living species of rodent, classified within the genus  Hydrochoerus , the only other extant member of which is the  lesser capybara  ( H. isthmius ). Its close relatives include  guinea pigs  and  rock cavies , and it is more distantly related to the  agouti , the  chinchilla , and the  nutria . The capybara is a highly social species and inhabits savannas and dense forests, living near bodies of water. It is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin. This photograph, taken in the  Pantanal , a wetland region in western Brazil, shows a cattle tyrant perching on the head of a capybara.
