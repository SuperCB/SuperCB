>The  Hayden Bridge  is a wrought-iron  truss bridge  that was manufactured by the  Phoenixville Bridge Works  in the U.S. state of  Pennsylvania . It was built in 1882 and was initially located near  Corinne, Utah , crossing the  Bear River  as part of the  first transcontinental railroad . In 1901, the bridge was moved more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) and reassembled at its present location, crossing the  McKenzie River  in  Springfield, Oregon , where it served as part of the Marcola line for the distribution of  lumber . It later closed down due to the closure of the area's lumbermills, until it was converted into a pedestrian bridge in 2019. It is the oldest intact bridge in the state of  Oregon . This photograph of the Hayden Bridge was taken as part of a 1990 Historic American Engineering Record survey.
