>Snake handling in Christianity  is a rite performed in several churches in the United States. Originating in rural  Appalachia , the first instance of snake handling was seen about 1910.  Pentecostal  minister  George Went Hensley  was prominent in the early development of the rite. Practitioners commonly quote the  gospels of Luke  and  Mark  to support the practice. Practitioners are also encouraged to  lay hands  on the sick,  speak in tongues , and occasionally drink poisons. This photograph, taken by the American photographer  Russell Lee  in 1946, depicts snake handling at the Church of God with Signs Following, a Pentecostal church in  Lejunior, Kentucky .
