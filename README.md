>Ely Cathedral  is an  Anglican  cathedral in the city of  Ely  in Cambridgeshire, England. The cathedral can trace its origin to an  abbey  founded in Ely in 672 by St  Æthelthryth  (also called Etheldreda). The earliest parts of the present building date to 1083, and it was granted cathedral status in 1109. Until the  Reformation  the cathedral was dedicated to St Etheldreda and St Peter, at which point it was refounded as the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely. It is the cathedral of the  Diocese of Ely  and seat of the  Bishop of Ely . Ely Cathedral was built in a monumental  Romanesque  style, with the  galilee  porch,  lady chapel  and  choir  later rebuilt in an exuberant  Decorated Gothic . Its central octagonal tower and the West Tower give it a prominent position above the surrounding flat landscape. This photograph shows the cathedral's lady chapel.
