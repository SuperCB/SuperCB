>The Mocking of Christ  is a small 13th-century  panel painting  by the Italian artist  Cimabue , in  tempera  on a  poplar  panel. It depicts the  mocking of Jesus  and is one of three panels known from Cimabue's  Diptych of Devotion . It was discovered in the kitchen of an elderly woman in northern France. In October 2019 it sold at auction for €24 million, a record for an artwork predating the 16th century. It is believed to be the first work by Cimabue to have been auctioned. Following an export ban, it was acquired by the  Louvre  in 2023.
