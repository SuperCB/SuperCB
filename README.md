>The  Kefermarkt altarpiece  is a richly decorated wooden  altarpiece  in the  Late Gothic style  in the parish church of  Kefermarkt  in  Upper Austria . Commissioned by the knight Christoph von Zelking, it was completed around 1497.  Saints Peter ,  Wolfgang  and  Christopher  are depicted in the central section. The wing panels depict scenes from the life of  Mary , and the altarpiece also has an intricate superstructure and two side figures of  Saints George  and  Florian . The identity of its maker, known by the  notname   Master of the Kefermarkt Altarpiece , is unknown, but at least two skilled sculptors appear to have created the main statuary. Throughout the centuries, it has been altered and lost its original paint and  gilding ; a major restoration was undertaken in the 19th century under the direction of  Adalbert Stifter . The altarpiece has been described as "one of the greatest achievements in late-medieval sculpture in the German-speaking area". This image shows the lower-right wing panel of the Kefermarkt altarpiece, depicting the  Adoration of the Magi . Mary gazes on the infant Christ while one of the  Magi  is kneeling in front of him; the child plays with the gold in the box he is bringing. Both he and the second of the Magi, behind him, have taken off their hats as a mark of respect.
