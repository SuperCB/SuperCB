>The  Roman Forum  is a rectangular  forum  (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings in the centre of the city of  Rome . Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the  Forum Magnum , or simply the  Forum . It is located in the small valley between the  Palatine  and  Capitoline Hills . Archaeological evidence shows that the site was originally a grassy  wetland , which was drained in the 7th century BC with the building of the first structures of the  Cloaca Maxima  sewer system. The earliest structures in the Forum were discovered in two separate locations: the site of the  Comitium  and the group of sanctuaries of  Regia ,  House of the Vestals  and Domus Publica. Further structures were added over the centuries including the  Temple of Saturn  (497 BC), the  Temple of Castor and Pollux  (484 BC) and the  Basilica Fulvia  (179 BC), followed by major work in the 80s BC, in which the plaza was raised and permanent marble paving stones laid. Further significant work was undertaken by  Julius Caesar  and  Augustus , and the reign of  Constantine the Great  saw the completion of the construction of the  Basilica of Maxentius  (AD 312), the last significant expansion of the complex. The Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly. This panoramic photograph, taken in 2018 from the  Capitoline Museums , shows some of the  surviving structures of the Roman Forum , including the  Tabularium , the  Gemonian stairs , the  Tarpeian Rock , and several temples and  basilicas .
