>The  Réunion stonechat  ( Saxicola tectes ) is a species of  stonechat  in the family Muscicapidae, the  Old World flycatchers . It is found across the French Indian Ocean island of  Réunion  in forests, shrublands, and artificial environments such as gardens and plantations. The Réunion stonechat is a member of the  common stonechat  superspecies, but it is distinct, together with its closest relative the  Madagascar stonechat , from the rest of that group being insular derivatives of the  African stonechat . The male is black above and white below, with a white  supercilium  (sometimes absent), half-collar, covert patch, and a variable-sized orange patch on the breast. Females differ from males in being browner above, more buff-toned below, and often lacking the white greater covert patch. This male Réunion stonechat was photographed in La Roche Écrite, south of the Réunion capital  Saint-Denis .
