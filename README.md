>Amphipoea oculea , the ear moth, is a  moth  in the family  Noctuidae , with a  wingspan  of 29 to 34 millimetres (1.1 to 1.3 inches). Its range includes southern England, where it is widespread and common, as well as Ireland and continental Europe, with the exception of Albania, Greece and Turkey. Adults are found from June to September depending on the location, with  one generation  occurring per year. At night the moths come to light and flowers, seeking  honeydew  and sugar. During the day they feed at the flowers of  thistles  and  ragwort . This female  A. oculea  moth was photographed feeding on  field scabious  in  Keila , Estonia. The photograph was  focus-stacked  from 22 separate images.
