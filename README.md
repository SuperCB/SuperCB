>Pinot gris , or pinot grigio, is a grape variety of the species  Vitis vinifera  used to make  white wine . Thought to be a  mutant  clone of  pinot noir , it normally has a pinkish-gray hue, accounting for its name, but the colors can vary from blue-gray to pinkish-brown. Pinot gris thrives in cooler climates, with the major growing regions being  Alsace  in France, northeastern Italy and the U.S. state of  Oregon . The wines vary greatly with these regions; for example,  Alsatian  pinot gris wines are medium to full-bodied and tend to be spicy in comparison with others. This photograph of a bunch of pinot gris grapes was  focus-stacked  from twelve separate frames.
