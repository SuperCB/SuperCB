In his first term as governor, he oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new  excise  taxes and the state's first  income tax , and helped improve the state's education and transportation systems. He resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the Senate. A  fiscal conservative  and disciple of  Virginia 's  Harry F. Byrd , Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's  New Deal  and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize  European operations in World War II  over the  Pacific War . In 1945, he resigned his Senate seat to become the  commissioner of baseball , succeeding  Kenesaw Mountain Landis . He approved  Jackie Robinson 's contract with the  Brooklyn Dodgers , initiating the  racial integration  of  Major League Baseball .
