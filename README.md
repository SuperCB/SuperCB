>The  Cathedral of La Laguna  is a Roman Catholic church in  San Cristóbal de La Laguna , on the Spanish island of  Tenerife  in the  Canary Islands . The church was designated a  cathedral  in 1818 and is the seat of the  Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna , which includes the islands of Tenerife,  La Palma ,  La Gomera  and  El Hierro . The current building was constructed between 1904 and 1915 to replace an earlier building begun in 1515. The cathedral is located in the historic centre of La Laguna and was declared a  World Heritage Site  in 1999 by  UNESCO . It contains elements of several architectural styles and is noted for its  Neoclassical  facade, inspired by  Pamplona Cathedral , as well as its dome, which stands out prominently in the city landscape. In the cathedral lie the remains of  Alonso Fernández de Lugo , the conqueror of the island and founder of the La Laguna. This photograph shows one of the  side chapels  of the Cathedral of La Laguna, with a 6-metre-tall (20 ft) gilded  reredos  behind the  altar . Constructed in the  Baroque  style in the first half of the 18th century, the reredos is the largest in the Canary Islands. The chapel is dedicated to the  Virgin of Los Remedios , whose statue is in the central niche behind the altar. The reredos features seven paintings, attributed to  Hendrick van Balen , depicting scenes from the lives of  Jesus  and  Mary .
