>The  European bison  ( Bison bonasus ), also known as the wisent, is a mammal in the family  Bovidae . It is one of two extant species of  bison . Having been hunted to  extinction in the wild  by the early 20th century, the European bison was reintroduced to the wild in various European countries by the 2010s, following  captive breeding  programmes. It is the heaviest wild  land animal  in Europe, and individuals in the past may have been even larger than their modern-day descendants. The largest bulls of the species have a mass of up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb). The European bison is a  herd  animal, which lives in both mixed and solely male groups. Mixed groups consist of adult females, calves, young aged two to three years, and young adult bulls. A typical herd numbers around eight to thirteen animals on average. This male European bison was photographed in the  Białowieża Forest , Poland.
