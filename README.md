>Say's phoebe  ( Sayornis saya ) is a bird species in the  tyrant flycatcher  family, Tyrannidae. A common bird across western North America, it prefers dry, desolate areas. The species was named after  Thomas Say , an American naturalist. It has a diet consisting primarily of insects such as grasshoppers, flies, crickets, beetles and bees, and occasionally small fish. Similar to the  eastern phoebe , it  sallies  from a perch to catch insects in mid-air. Like other  phoebes , it creates nests under bridges, canyon walls, wells and abandoned mine shafts, the cup-shaped nest created by the female out of grass and other fine materials. Say's phoebes have been found to breed anytime between late March and late August, egg clutches numbering between three and seven. Say's phoebe is known to use "song-like" displays as its main form of communication. The song is characterized as having a very loud pitch to begin and then slowly leveling off into a more steady pitch. This Say's phoebe was photographed in  Grasslands National Park  in  Saskatchewan , Canada.
