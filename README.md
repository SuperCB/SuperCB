>John F. Kennedy  (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963) was an American politician who served as the 35th  president of the United States  from 1961 until  his assassination in 1963 . He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure. Kennedy served at the height of the  Cold War , and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A  Democrat  from  Massachusetts , Kennedy served in both houses of the  United States Congress  prior to his presidency. This photograph of Kennedy in his  presidential state car  was taken by Walt Cisco of  The Dallas Morning News  minutes before his assassination in  Dallas, Texas , on November 22, 1963.
