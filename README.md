>The  Kefermarkt altarpiece  is a richly decorated wooden  altarpiece  in the  Late Gothic style  in the parish church of  Kefermarkt  in  Upper Austria . Commissioned by the knight Christoph von Zelking, it was completed around 1497.  Saints Peter ,  Wolfgang  and  Christopher  are depicted in the central section. The wing panels depict scenes from the life of  Mary , and the altarpiece also has an intricate superstructure and two side figures of  Saints George  and  Florian . The identity of its maker, known by the  notname   Master of the Kefermarkt Altarpiece , is unknown, but at least two skilled sculptors appear to have created the main statuary. Throughout the centuries, it has been altered and lost its original paint and  gilding ; a major restoration was undertaken in the 19th century under the direction of  Adalbert Stifter . The altarpiece has been described as "one of the greatest achievements in late-medieval sculpture in the German-speaking area". This image shows the upper-left wing panel of the Kefermarkt altarpiece, depicting the  birth of Christ . Mary is portrayed kneeling in devotion in front of the  infant Christ , who is placed before her on a fold of her dress. On the other side,  Joseph  is also kneeling in front of the child. Above Mary, on the roof of the building behind them, are two angels playing a  mandolin  and a  lute . The  annunciation to the shepherds  can be seen in the background.
