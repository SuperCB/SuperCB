>The  Indian pied myna  ( Gracupica contra ) is a species of  starling  found in the Indian subcontinent, with a principal distribution from the  Gangetic plains  extending south to the  Krishna River . This range has increased in recent times, with populations established in Pakistan, western India and also Dubai. The spread has been aided by changes in irrigation and farming patterns and accidental escape of caged birds. The Indian pied myna is found mainly in lowland open areas with scattered trees near water, often near human habitation, but also inhabits areas up to around 700 metres (2,300 ft) in altitude. It has a black-and-white plumage with a yellowish bill and a reddish bill base. This pair of Indian pied mynas was photographed outside the city of  Hapur  in  Uttar Pradesh , India.
