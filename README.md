>The  Palácio Rio Negro  is a palace in  Petrópolis  in the state of  Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. One of the official residences of the  president of Brazil , it is used mainly as a country retreat. The palace was designed by the Italian architect Antonio Jannuzzi in 1889 and built in the same year as a summer residence for Manuel Gomes de Carvalho, Baron of Rio Negro. He moved to Paris in 1894, leaving the building empty, and in February 1896 the palace and adjacent buildings were sold to the state of Rio de Janeiro to serve as the official residence of the state governor. It was then acquired by the  federal government of Brazil  in 1903, becoming the official presidential summer residence. This photograph depicts the façade of the Palácio Rio Negro in 2015.
