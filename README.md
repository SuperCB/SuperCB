>The  Crucifixion and Last Judgement Diptych  consists of two small painted panels attributed to the  Early Netherlandish  artist  Jan van Eyck , with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. The  diptych  is one of the early  Northern Renaissance  oil-on-panel masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed  iconography , and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just 56.5 cm (22.2 in) high by 19.7 cm (7.8 in) wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion. The left wing depicts the  Crucifixion , while the right wing portrays scenes associated with the  Last Judgement : a  hellscape  at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of  Christ in Majesty  flanked by a  Great Deësis . The diptych is now in the  Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York City, United States.
