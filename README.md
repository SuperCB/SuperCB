>The  coronation of Napoleon  was the crowning of  Napoleon  and his wife  Joséphine  as  Emperor  and  Empress of the French , which took place on December 2, 1804, at  Notre-Dame cathedral  in Paris. It took the format of a sacred ceremony, in the presence of  Pope Pius VII . Preparations for the coronation began in May 1804, when the  Sénat conservateur  voted to change the constitution to vest the government of the  French First Republic 's government in an emperor, a move ratified  a constitutional referendum in November 1804 . Napoleon's motivations for being crowned included a desire for prestige in international  royalist  and  Catholic  circles and to lay the foundation for a future dynasty. The event is also regarded by historians as a progaganda exercise. Napoleon's coronation was markedly different from  those of the French monarchy  and brought together various rites and customs, incorporating ceremonies of  Carolingian  tradition, the  ancien régime  and the  French Revolution , with a highly luxurious presentation. This large  oil-on-canvas  painting, titled  The Coronation of Napoleon , measures 6.21 m × 9.79 m (20 ft 4 in × 32 ft 1 in) and was painted by  Jacques-Louis David  (assisted by his student  Georges Rouget ) between 1805 and 1807, depicting the moment of Joséphine's crowning by Napoleon. The painting now hangs in the  Louvre  in Paris.
