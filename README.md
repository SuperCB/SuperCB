>C/2022 E3 (ZTF)  is a  non-periodic comet  from the  Oort cloud  that was discovered by the  Zwicky Transient Facility  (ZTF) in 2022. With a   comet nucleus  of around 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) in diameter, C/2022 E3 rotates on its axis once every 8.5 to 8.7 hours. Its  tails  of dust and gas extended for millions of kilometers and, during January 2023, an  anti-tail  was also visible. The comet reached its most recent  perihelion  in January 2023, at a distance of 1.11 AU (166 million km; 103 million mi) from the sun, and the closest approach to Earth was a few weeks later, at a distance of 0.28 AU (42 million km; 26 million mi). The comet reached  magnitude  5 and was visible with the  naked eye  under moonless  dark skies . This photograph of C/2022 E3 was taken in January 2023 and released by the Italian  National Institute for Astrophysics .
