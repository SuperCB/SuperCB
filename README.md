>Joseph Fourier  (21 March 1768 – 16 May 1830) was a French  mathematician  and  physicist  born in  Auxerre  and best known for initiating the investigation of  Fourier series , which eventually developed into  Fourier analysis  and  harmonic analysis , and their applications to problems of  heat transfer  and  vibration . The  Fourier transform  and  Fourier's law of conduction  are also named after him. He is also generally credited with the discovery of the  greenhouse effect . This  engraving  of Fourier was drawn by  Julien-Léopold Boilly , a French artist noted for his album of  lithographs  titled  Iconographie de l'Institut Royal de France  (1820–1821) and his booklet  Album de 73 portraits-charge aquarellés des membres de l'Institut  (1820), containing watercolor  caricatures  of seventy-three members of the  Institut de France .
