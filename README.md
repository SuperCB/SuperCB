>ATLAS  is the largest general-purpose  particle detector  experiment at the  Large Hadron Collider  (LHC), a  particle accelerator  at  CERN  (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The experiment is designed to take advantage of the unprecedented energy available at the LHC and observe phenomena that involve highly massive  particles  which were not observable using earlier lower-energy accelerators. ATLAS was one of the two LHC experiments involved in the discovery of the  Higgs boson  in July 2012. It was also designed to search for evidence of theories of  particle physics  beyond the  Standard Model . This image shows the eight  toroid  magnets surrounding the  calorimeter  in the centre.
