>Germanicus Julius Caesar  (24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was an  ancient Roman  general and politician most famously known for his campaigns against  Arminius  in  Germania . The son of  Nero Claudius Drusus  and  Antonia Minor , Germanicus was born into an influential branch of the  patrician   gens Claudia . The  agnomen   Germanicus  was added to his full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania. In AD 4 he was adopted by his paternal uncle  Tiberius , himself the stepson and heir of Germanicus' great-uncle  Augustus ; ten years later, Tiberius succeeded Augustus as  Roman emperor . As a result of his adoption, Germanicus became an official member of the  gens Julia , another prominent family, to which he was related on his mother's side. His connection to the  Julii Caesares  was further consolidated through a marriage between him and  Agrippina the Elder , a granddaughter of Augustus. He was also the father of  Caligula , the maternal grandfather of  Nero , and the older brother of  Claudius . This  bust , depicting Germanicus in AD 4, is in the collection of the  J. Paul Getty Museum .
