>Charles Roscoe Savage  (August 16, 1832 – February 4, 1909) was a British-born landscape and portrait  photographer  most notable for his images of the American West. Savage converted to  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  in his youth while living in England. He served a mission in Switzerland and eventually moved to the United States. In America he became interested in photography and began taking portraits for hire in the East. He traveled to  Salt Lake City  with his family and opened up his Art Bazar where he sold many of his photographs. Savage concentrated his photographic efforts primarily on family portraits, landscapes, and documentary views. He is best known for his 1869 photographs of the linking of the  first transcontinental railroad  at  Promontory, Utah . This self-portrait of Savage was taken in the 1880s.
