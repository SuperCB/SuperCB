>The  common blackbird  ( Turdus merula ) is a species of  true thrush . It breeds in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been  introduced  to Canada, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, the  Falkland Islands , Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It has several subspecies across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on  latitude , the common blackbird may be resident, partially  migratory , or fully migratory. The male of the  nominate subspecies , which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and  bill  and has a rich, melodious  song ; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown  plumage . The species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is  omnivorous , eating a wide range of  insects ,  earthworms ,  berries , and  fruits . This common and conspicuous bird has given rise to many literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song. This female common blackbird, of the subspecies  T. m. mauritanicus , was photographed in the  Souss-Massa National Park , Morocco.
