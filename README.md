>Arabis hirsuta , also known as the hairy rock-cress, is a  flowering plant  of the genus  Arabis  in the family  Brassicaceae . In previous North American works, this species has been broadly defined to include plants native to Europe, Asia, and the northern half of North America, but the name is now more often used to describe a narrower subgroup. The species grows on chalk slopes, dunes, hedgebanks, walls and rocks.  Arabis hirsuta  grows to a height of up to around 75 centimetres (30 inches) and is usually unbranched, with a long spike of flowers and stiff hairs. The lower leaves of the plant form a rosette, while the stalkless upper leaves clasp the stem. Flowering is from June to August. It has white petals, cylindrical fruits pressed close to the stem and reddish brown seeds. This  A. hirsuta  plant at the start of its flowering phase was photographed in  Keila , Estonia.
