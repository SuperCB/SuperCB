>The  ocellated turkey  ( Meleagris ocellata ) is a species of  turkey  residing primarily in the  Yucatán Peninsula , Mexico, as well as in parts of Belize and Guatemala. It is a relative of the North American  wild turkey  ( Meleagris gallopavo ), although it is somewhat smaller. The body feathers of both sexes are a mixture of bronze and green  iridescent  color, with neither sex possessing the  beard  typically found in wild turkeys. Tail feathers of both sexes are bluish-grey with an eye-shaped, blue-bronze spot near the end with a bright gold tip. These spots, or  ocelli  (for which the ocellated turkey is named) have been likened to the patterning typically found on peafowl. This ocellated turkey was photographed near  Tikal  in the Petén region of Guatemala.
