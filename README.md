>Ama Dablam  is a mountain located in the eastern  Himalayas  in  Koshi Province , Nepal. The main peak is at an elevation of 6,812 metres (22,349 feet) above sea level, and the lower western peak is at 6,170 metres (20,243 feet). The name means 'mother's necklace' in  Sherpa ; the long ridges on each side are thought to resemble the arms of a mother ( ama ) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier is the  dablam , the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods and worn by Sherpa women. For several days, the mountain dominates the eastern sky for trekkers to  South Base Camp  on  Mount Everest . Due to its soaring ridges and steep faces, Ama Dablam is sometimes referred as the " Matterhorn  of the Himalayas". The mountain is featured on the Nepalese one- rupee  banknote. This photograph of Ama Dablam as seen from Chola Valley was taken in October 2009.
