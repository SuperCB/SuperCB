>Ganymede  is a  moon of Jupiter  and the  largest and most massive  satellite in the  Solar System . It is the largest Solar System object without a substantial atmosphere and also the only moon in the Solar System with a substantial  magnetic field . Like  Titan , Saturn's largest moon, it is larger than the planet Mercury but, due to its lower density, has somewhat less  surface gravity  than Mercury,  Io , or the Moon. Ganymede is composed of  silicate  rock and water in approximately equal proportions. It is a fully  differentiated  body, with an iron-rich liquid core and an  internal ocean . Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4  orbital resonance  with  Europa  and Io. This image, a composite of three photographs taken by the NASA space probe  Juno  during a flyby in 2021, depicts the northern hemisphere of Ganymede roughly centered around the  prime meridian .
