>Geraldine Ulmar  (June 23, 1862 – August 13, 1932) was an American  soprano  and actress known for her performances in  Savoy operas  with the  D'Oyly Carte Opera Company . In 1879, she made her debut in  Boston  as Josephine in  Gilbert and Sullivan 's  H.M.S. Pinafore  and soon joined the  Boston Ideal Opera Company , where she remained as leading soprano for six years. From 1885 to 1886, Ulmar played Yum-Yum in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's first American production of  The Mikado  in New York. Over the next two years she played further Gilbert and Sullivan roles in New York, Germany and England. In London, she was the first to play the leading characters of Elsie Maynard in  The Yeomen of the Guard  (1888) and Gianetta in  The Gondoliers  (1889) before leaving D'Oyly Carte in 1890. She remained in Britain to play leading roles in other works, such as O Mimosa San in the  musical comedy   The Geisha . In 1904 she retired from the stage and taught singing. Ulmar was married to composer  Ivan Caryll  for a time. The photo shows Ulmar as Yum-Yum in New York in 1886.
