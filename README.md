>Selimiye Mosque  is a mosque in  North Nicosia  in the de facto state of  Northern Cyprus , and the principal Islamic place of worship on the island of Cyprus. It was constructed as a Christian church known as the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, which was built on the site of an earlier  Byzantine  church, and was consecrated in 1326. It was converted to a mosque in 1570, following the 50-day  siege of Nicosia , when the area became part of the  Ottoman Empire . A pair of  minarets  and other Islamic features were added at that time.
