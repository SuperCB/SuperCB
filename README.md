>Suffren  was a  predreadnought battleship  built for the  French Navy  and completed in 1902. The ship was assigned to the  Mediterranean Squadron  for most of her career and often served as a  flagship . She twice collided with French ships and twice had  propeller shafts  break before the start of World War I in 1914.  Suffren  was assigned to the  naval operations off the Dardanelles , participating in a series of attacks on  Ottoman  fortifications. She was moderately damaged on 18 March 1915 and was sent to  Toulon  for repairs. She returned to provide gunfire support for the  Allied  forces during the  Gallipoli campaign .  Suffren  provided covering fire as the Allies withdrew from the peninsula and accidentally sank one of the evacuation ships. She was then assigned to the squadron tasked to prevent  Greek  interference with Allied operations on the  Salonica Front . While en route to  Lorient  for a  refit ,  Suffren  was  torpedoed  off  Lisbon  by a German submarine on 26 November 1916 and sunk with all hands. This photograph shows  Suffren  off  Toulon  in October 1911.
