>The  six-spot burnet  ( Zygaena filipendulae ) is a  moth  of the family  Zygaenidae . It is a common species throughout Europe, except the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, northern Scandinavia and the Great Russian North, and is also present in Asia Minor, through the Caucasus to Syria and Lebanon. It inhabits meadows, woodland clearings, sea-cliffs and area rich in grasses and flowers, up to 2,000 m altitude. The adults fly on hot, sunny days and are attracted to a wide variety of flowers such as  knapweed  and  scabious , as well as the larval food plants  bird's foot trefoil ,  Dorycnium ,  Coronilla  and  clover . This six-spot burnet was photographed in  Kulna , Estonia.
