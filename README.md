>Racial segregation in the United States  included the legally or socially enforced separation of  African Americans  from  White Americans , as well as the separation of other  ethnic minorities  from majority communities. Facilities and services such as  housing ,  healthcare ,  education ,  employment  and  transportation in the United States  have been systematically separated based on  racial categorizations . The  Supreme Court  upheld the constitutionality of segregation in  Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896), so long as " separate but equal " facilities were provided, a requirement that was rarely met. The doctrine's applicability to public schools was unanimously overturned in  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954), and several landmark cases including  Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States  (1964) further ruled against racial segregation, helping to bring an end to the  Jim Crow laws . During the  civil rights movement ,  de jure  segregation was formally outlawed by the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the  Fair Housing Act of 1968 , while  de facto  segregation continues today in areas including  residential segregation  and  school segregation , as part of ongoing  racism  and  discrimination in the United States . This photograph, taken in 1939 by  Russell Lee , shows an African-American man drinking at a water dispenser, with a sign reading " Colored ", in a streetcar terminal in  Oklahoma City .
