>The  Arena of Nîmes  is a  Roman amphitheatre  situated in the French city of  Nîmes . Built around 100 CE, shortly after the  Colosseum  in Rome, it is one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheatres in the world. It is also among the twenty largest Roman amphitheatres of the 400 in existence. It is 133 metres long (145 yd) and 101 metres wide (110 yd), with an arena measuring 68 metres by 38 metres (74 yd by 42 yd). The outer facade is 21 metres high (69 ft) with two stories of 60  arcades . This photograph of the exterior of the amphitheatre was taken in 2019.
