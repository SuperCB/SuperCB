>Heungseon Daewongun  (1821–1898) was the title of Yi Ha-eung, the regent of  Joseon  during the minority of  Emperor Gojong  in the 1860s. Until his death, he was a key political figure of late-Joseon Korea. The Daewongun is remembered both for the wide-ranging reforms that he attempted during his regency, as well as for what was described by historian Hilary Conroy as "vigorous enforcement of the seclusion policy, persecution of Christians, and the killing or driving off of foreigners who landed on Korean soil". This  silk painting  of the Daewongun, now in the collection of the  National Museum of Korea , was created by an unknown artist circa 1869. It is designated as a  Treasure of Korea .
