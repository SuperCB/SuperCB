>Blue-ice areas  are regions of Antarctica where the ice surface has a blue colour, contrasting with the more common white Antarctic surface. They form around 1% of the continent's ice area. Blue-ice areas typically form when the movement of both air and ice are obstructed by topographic obstacles such as mountains that emerge from the  ice sheet , generating particular climatic conditions where the net snow accumulation is exceeded by wind-driven sublimation and snow transports. They are noted for being hard and flat, enabling their use as a runway, in addition to their stability. Ice of up to 2.7 million years in age has been extracted from blue-ice areas. There are also large numbers of  meteorites  accumulated on them, either from direct falls or having been transported from elsewhere by  ice flow . This NASA photograph shows a blue-ice area in the  Miller Range , with a meteorite.
