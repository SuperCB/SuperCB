>The  thousand-yard stare  (also referred to as the two-thousand-yard stare) is the  blank , unfocused gaze of people experiencing  dissociation  due to acute stress or traumatic events. The phrase was originally used to describe war  combatants  and the  post-traumatic stress  they exhibited but is now also used to refer to an unfocused gaze observed in people under any stressful situation, or in people with certain  mental health conditions . The thousand-yard stare is sometimes described as an effect of  shell shock  or  combat stress reaction , along with other mental health conditions. However, it is not a formal  medical term . This painting by the  war artist   Thomas C. Lea III , titled  Marines Call It That 2,000 Yard Stare , popularized the term after it was published in   Life  in 1945. It depicts an unnamed  US Marine  at the  Battle of Peleliu , which took place in 1944.
