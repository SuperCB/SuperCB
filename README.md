>Stuben am Arlberg  is a winter sports resort in the town of  Klösterle  in the westernmost Austrian province of  Vorarlberg . It is located at an altitude of 1,410 metres (4,630 ft) and had 90 inhabitants in 2019. The settlement of Klösterle probably originated in the 9th century, at a time of silver mining in the  Klostertal  valley and the neighbouring  Montafon  valley, with the first known mention of Stuben occurring in a 1330 document describing it as a post station and the " Kaiser 's highest living room". In the late 19th century, Stuben became a popular skiing and tourist resort and is now part of  Ski Arlberg , Austria's largest skiing area. In the summer months the area is popular with hikers and mountain bikers. This aerial view from the north-west shows Stuben am Arlberg and the winding Arlbergstrasse, which passes through the resort.
