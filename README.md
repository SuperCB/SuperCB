>A plan of the cities of London and Westminster, and borough of Southwark  is a 1746 map of the  City of London  and surrounding area, surveyed by  John Rocque  and engraved by  John Pine . Rocque combined two surveying techniques: he made a ground-level survey with a compass and a physical metal chain – the unit of length also being the  chain .  Compass bearings  were taken of the lines measured. He also created a  triangulation  network over the entire area to be covered by taking readings from church towers and similar high places using a  theodolite  made by  Jonathan Sisson  (inventor of the telescopic-sighted theodolite) to measure the observed angle between two other prominent locations. The process was repeated from point to point. This image depicts all 24 sheets of Rocque's map.
