>The Blind Girl  (1856) is a painting by  John Everett Millais  which depicts two itinerant  beggars , presumed to be sisters, one of whom is a blind  musician , her  concertina  on her lap. They are resting by the roadside after a rainstorm, before travelling to the town of  Winchelsea , visible in the background. The painting has been interpreted as an  allegory  of the senses, contrasting the experiences of the blind and sighted sisters. The former feels the warmth of the sun on her face, and fondles a blade of grass, while the latter shields her eyes from the sun or rain and looks at a  double rainbow  that has just appeared. The painting is in the collection of the  Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery .
