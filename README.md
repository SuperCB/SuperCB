>Apollo 9  was the third  crewed mission  in the United States  Apollo program . Launched by a  Saturn V  rocket from the  Kennedy Space Center  on March 3, 1969, and flown in  low Earth orbit , the mission  flight-qualified  the  Lunar Module  (LM), showing that its crew could fly it independently, then  rendezvous  and  dock , as would be required for  Apollo 11 , the first crewed lunar landing. Commander  James McDivitt , Command Module Pilot  David Scott , and Lunar Module Pilot  Rusty Schweickart  tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the Moon. A  spacewalk  tested the extravehicular  life support backpack . McDivitt and Schweickart, entering the LM through the docking tunnel, became the first humans to pass between spacecraft without going outside them, two months after Soviet  cosmonauts  spacewalked to transfer between  Soyuz 4  and  Soyuz 5 . Apollo 9, a complete success, landed in the Atlantic Ocean on March 13 and was followed by  Apollo 10 , the dress rehearsal for Apollo 11. This photograph, taken by Schweickart, shows Scott performing a stand-up  extravehicular activity  from the  Command Module   Gumdrop , seen from the docked LM  Spider  with the Earth in the background.
