>The  European bee-eater  ( Merops apiaster ) is a bird in the  bee-eater  family, Meropidae. It breeds in southern and central Europe, northern and southern Africa, and western Asia. Except for the resident southern African population, the species is strongly  migratory , wintering in tropical Africa. This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It has brown and yellow upper parts, whilst the wings are green and the beak is black. It can reach a length of 27–29 cm (10.6–11.4 in), including the two elongated central tail feathers. The most important prey item in its diet is  Hymenoptera , mostly the  European honey bee . Its impact on bee populations, however, is small. It eats less than 1% of the worker bees in areas where it lives. This group of three European bee-eaters, each with a  dragonfly  in its beak, was photographed in Kondor Tanya,  Kecskemét , Hungary.
