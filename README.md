>Theodore von Kármán  (1881–1963) was a  Hungarian-American  mathematician, aerospace engineer and physicist who worked in aeronautics and astronautics. He was responsible for crucial advances in  aerodynamics  characterizing  supersonic  airflow. The human-defined threshold of outer space is named the  Kármán line  in recognition of his work. This 1959 photograph shows von Kármán  (left)  joined by  United States Air Force  and  NASA  officials while inspecting two missile models used in the high-velocity, high-altitude  wind tunnels  at  Arnold Air Force Base . The missiles shown are the  AGARD-B  and the  Atlas   Series-B .
