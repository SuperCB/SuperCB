>The  gold dollar  is a  gold coin  that was struck as a regular issue by the  United States Bureau of the Mint  from 1849 to 1889. It had three types over its lifetime, all designed by Mint chief engraver  James B. Longacre . The Type 1 issue had the smallest diameter of any United States coin ever minted. A gold dollar had been proposed several times in the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion from the  California gold rush , and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress required in 1853 that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation amid the economic disruption of the  American Civil War . Gold did not circulate again in most of the nation until 1879, and even then, the gold dollar did not regain its place in commerce.  In its final years, struck in small numbers, it was hoarded by  speculators  and mounted in jewelry. These three gold dollars, depicting personifications of  Liberty  wearing a coronet and as an  Indian  princess, are part of the  National Numismatic Collection  at the  National Museum of American History .
