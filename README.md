>Ages Ago  is a musical entertainment with an English-language libretto by  W. S. Gilbert  and music by  Frederic Clay  that premiered in 1869 at the  Royal Gallery of Illustration  in London. It marked the beginning of a seven-year collaboration between Gilbert and Clay. The piece features a haunted Scottish castle inhabited by Sir Ebenezer Tare, with other characters including his niece, her poor suitor and a housekeeper with  second sight . The paintings of the castle's former owners come to life and step out of their frames. Gilbert re-used the device of paintings coming to life in his 1887 opera with  Arthur Sullivan ,  Ruddigore .  Ages Ago  was a critical and popular success and was revived many times, including at  St. George's Hall, London , in 1870 and 1874, and in New York in 1880. This  chromolithograph  theatre poster was created to advertise the original production of  Ages Ago  and is now in the collection of the  Victoria and Albert Museum .
