>The Cheat  is a 1923 American  silent drama film  produced by  Famous Players–Lasky  and distributed by  Paramount Pictures . It is a remake of  Cecil B. DeMille 's 1915 film  The Cheat , using the same script by  Hector Turnbull  and  Jeanie MacPherson . The remake stars  Pola Negri  and was directed by  George Fitzmaurice ,  and tells the story of Carmelita De Cordoba, a beautiful young South American woman who has been betrothed by her stern father to Don Pablo, whom she despises, and then meets and falls in love with Dudley Drake, a New York City broker. With no known prints of  The Cheat  remaining, it is considered a  lost film , although there is an extant version in novel form, written in the same year as the film by Russell Holman, a Paramount Pictures employee. This color  lithograph  poster was produced in 1923 by Paramount to promote  The Cheat , and depicts Negri as Carmelita with  Charles de Rochefort  as Claude Mace, an art swindler masquerading as the East Indian prince Rao-Singh.
