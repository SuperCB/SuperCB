>The  checkerboard wrasse  ( Halichoeres hortulanus ) is a species of fish belonging to the  wrasse  family. It is native to the  Indian Ocean  and central  Pacific Ocean . It is a small fish that can reach a maximum length of 27 centimetres (11 inches). Both its sex and appearance change during its life, and the colouring at each stage is variable based on location. Like many other wrasses, the checkerboard wrasse is a  protogynous hermaphrodite , starting life as a female and later becoming a male, changing sex at maturity when it is about 12.8 centimetres (5.0 inches) long. This checkerboard wrasse was photographed in the  Red Sea  off the coast of Egypt.
