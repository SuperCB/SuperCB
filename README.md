>John Henry Turpin  (1876–1962) was a sailor in the  United States Navy  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was one of the first African-American  chief petty officers  in the U.S. Navy, becoming a  chief gunner's mate  on the cruiser  Marblehead  in 1917. He was transferred to the  Fleet Reserve  in 1919 and retired in 1925. He is also notable for surviving the catastrophic explosions of two U.S. Navy ships:  USS  Maine  in 1898, and  USS  Bennington  in 1905.
