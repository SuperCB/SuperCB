>The  Zaniskari , also known as Zanskari, is a  breed  of small mountain horse or  pony  from  Ladakh , a region of  Kashmir  administered by India. It is named after  Zanskar , a valley or region in  Kargil district . It is similar to the  Spiti breed  of  Himachal Pradesh , but is better adapted to work at high altitudes. Like the Spiti, it shows similarities to the  breeds of neighbouring Tibet . The Zaniskari is of medium size, and is often  grey in colour . The breed is considered endangered, as there are only a few hundred alive today, and a conservation programme has been started at  Padum , in the Kargil district of Ladakh. This Zaniskari horse was photographed in central Ladakh.
