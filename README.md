>Mount Rundle  is a mountain in  Banff National Park  that overlooks the towns of  Banff  and  Canmore  in the Canadian province of  Alberta . Geologically, it consists of  limestones ,  dolomitic  limestones,  dolomites  and  shales  of  Paleozoic  age. In ascending order, they belong to the  Palliser ,  Exshaw  and  Banff Formations , topped by the  Rundle Group , which was named after the mountain. Mount Rundle could be considered a small mountain range as the mountain extends for more than 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) on the south side of the  Trans-Canada Highway  eastward from Banff to Canmore, and has seven distinct peaks. The southeasternmost of these peaks is the  East End of Rundle , pictured here from the trail to  Ha Ling Peak , with Whitemans Pond in the foreground.
