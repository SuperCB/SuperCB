>Ruby Nell Bridges Hall  (born September 8, 1954) is an American civil rights activist. She was the  first African American  child to attend the formerly  whites -only  William Frantz Elementary School  in  Louisiana  during the  New Orleans school desegregation crisis  on November 14, 1960. Bridges attended a segregated  kindergarten  in 1959. In early 1960, she was one of six black children in New Orleans to pass the test that determined whether they could go to the all-white William Frantz Elementary School. Two of the six decided to stay at their old school, Bridges went to Frantz by herself, and  three children  (Gail Etienne,  Leona Tate  and Tessie Prevost) were transferred to the all-white  McDonogh No. 19 Elementary School . All four 6-year-old girls were escorted to and from school by  federal marshals  due to crowds of angry protestors opposing school integration.
