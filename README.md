>Many  artworks related to the Black Lives Matter movement  have been created. These works are seen as a direct tribute to those who have died or more broadly to the movement. Often the pieces are  created in the streets  as to be more publicly visible. This mural in  Greenpoint, Brooklyn  lists the names of  African Americans killed by law enforcement officers in the United States , ending with  George Floyd , whose  murder on May 25, 2020  sparked  global protests  that raised the visibility of the  Black Lives Matter  movement.
