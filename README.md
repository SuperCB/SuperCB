>The  Dale Creek Crossing  was a 650-foot (200 m) bridge in the southeastern  Wyoming Territory , United States, completed in 1868. It was constructed by the  Union Pacific Railroad  as part of the  first transcontinental railroad . With a maximum height of 150 feet (46 m) and with a necessity of cutting through solid rock on both sides, it was one of the most difficult parts of the line to build. The original bridge was built of wood, and its trestles began swaying in the wind from the opening day. The original bridge was replaced on the 1868 piers in 1876 by an iron bridge, manufactured by the  American Bridge Company , and this was dismantled entirely in 1901 when the Union Pacific completed construction of a new alignment over Sherman Hill as part of a reconstruction project which shortened the  Overland Route . This photograph of the Dale Creek Crossing was taken during construction in 1868 by the project's official photographer,  Andrew J. Russell .
