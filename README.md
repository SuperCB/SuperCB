>Edward Bouchet  (1852–1918) was an American  physicist  and educator. He was the first  African American  to earn a PhD from an American university, completing his  dissertation  in physics at  Yale University  in 1876. Bouchet had become one of the first African Americans to graduate from Yale College in 1874. On the basis of his academic record, he was elected to  Phi Beta Kappa , an academic  honor society . Unable to find a university-teaching or research-facility position due to  racial discrimination , he moved to  Philadelphia  in 1876 and took a position at the  Institute for Colored Youth , where he taught physics and chemistry for the next 26 years. This photograph of Bouchet, from the archives of Yale, is part of a portrait album of students in the class of 1874.
