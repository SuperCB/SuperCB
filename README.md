>The  Bünting cloverleaf map  is a historic  mappa mundi  drawn by the German theologian and cartographer  Heinrich Bünting . The map was published in his book  Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae  in 1581. The map depicts the three continents of the Old World, Europe, Africa and Asia, as three leaves forming the shape of a  clover , with  Jerusalem  at the centre. The three continents include captions for some of their countries and illustrations of cities. The clover is surrounded by the  ocean , with its surface including illustrations of sea creatures, monsters, and a ship. England and Denmark are represented as two island-shapes above Europe's leaf, while the  Americas  are shown as a mostly unrevealed shape in the lower left corner, captioned  Die Neue Welt  (the  New World ).
