>Sojourner Truth , born Isabella Baumfree, ( c.  1797  – 1883) was an American  abolitionist  and activist for  African-American civil rights ,  women's rights , and  alcohol temperance . Truth was born into slavery in  Swartekill, New York , but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son in 1828, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. This  cabinet card  of Truth was produced around 1864, and is now in the collection of the  National Museum of African American History and Culture .
