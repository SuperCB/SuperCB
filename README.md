>Fushimi Inari-taisha   is the main  Shinto shrine  of the Japanese deity  Inari Ōkami , located in  Fushimi-ku, Kyoto . It sits at the base of a mountain, also named Inari, located 233 metres (764 ft) above sea level. The site's earliest structures were built in 711 on the Inariyama hill in southwestern Kyoto, but the shrine was re-located in 816 on the request of the monk  Kūkai . It gained imperial patronage during the early  Heian period  and the main shrine structure was built in 1499. This photograph shows a  torii  path at Fushimi Inari-taisha with a hanging lantern. Each of the shrine's roughly 10,000  torii  (gates) was donated by a Japanese business, and approximately 800 of these are set up in rows, as depicted here, that give the impression of entering a tunnel.
