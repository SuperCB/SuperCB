>The  Giechburg  is a partly reconstructed hilltop castle located in the town of  Scheßlitz  in  Bavaria , Germany. There was a hilltop fort at the site from at least  Neolithic  times, and the castle enters written history in 1125. In 1390, it entered the possession of the  prince-bishops of Bamberg , and its history thereafter is closely allied to the bishopric and the city of  Bamberg . The castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times over the subsequent centuries before undergoing extensive redevelopment between 1599 and 1609. It became less useful to the prince-bishops over the subsequent centuries however, and eventually fell into ruin. After a period in the 19th and 20th centuries in the hands of the von Giech family, the castle was eventually acquired by the district of Bamberg in 1971 and reconstructed as a conference and hospitality centre. This 2021 aerial photograph shows the Giechburg viewed from the north, with the village of Peulendorf in the background.
