>The  jabiru  ( Jabiru mycteria ) is a large  stork  found in the Americas from Mexico to Argentina, except west of the  Andes , occasionally also moving into the southern United States. Its name comes from  Tupi–Guarani  and means 'swollen neck'. It is a tall bird, with larger males reaching a height of more than 1.5 metres (4.9 ft). It measures 2.3 to 2.8 metres (7.5 to 9.2 ft) across the wings, and can weigh up to 9 kilograms (20 lb). The  plumage  is mostly white, but the head and upper neck are featherless and black, with a featherless red stretchable patch at the base. This jabiru was photographed in the  Pantanal  area of Brazil.
