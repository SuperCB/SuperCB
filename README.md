>Boyd's forest dragon  ( Lophosaurus boydii ) is a species of arboreal  lizard  in the family  Agamidae . The species is native to  rainforests  and their margins in the  Wet Tropics  region of northern  Queensland , Australia. It spends the majority of its time perched on the trunks of trees, usually at around head height. It is a sit-and-wait predator, catching prey that it spies from its perch. Its diet consists primarily of  invertebrates , with  earthworms  making up a relatively high proportion. Small  fruits  and  vertebrates  are also occasionally consumed. This Boyd's forest dragon was photographed in  Daintree National Park .
