>The  orange-lined triggerfish  ( Balistapus undulatus ) is a species of marine  ray-finned fish  belonging to the  triggerfish  family, Balistidae. It has a wide  Indo-Pacific  range, and is typically found in  coral reefs , coral lagoons, and external reef slopes. The orange-lined triggerfish has a dark brown to dark green body with orange lines that start behind the head and cover the rest of its body. Its maximum body size is about 30 centimetres (12 inches), with the head about one-third of the body length. Due to its broad diet and distribution, the species is a crucial component in coral reef ecosystems through top-down control, and especially through consumption of  sea urchins . This orange-lined triggerfish was photographed in the  Red Sea  off the Egyptian coast.
