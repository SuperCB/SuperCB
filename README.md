>Eva Le Gallienne  (1899–1991) was a British-born American stage actress, producer, director, translator, and author. A  Broadway  star by age 21, Le Gallienne gave up her Broadway appearances to devote herself to founding the  Civic Repertory Theatre , in which she was both director, producer, and lead actress. Noted for her boldness and idealism, she became a pioneering figure in the American  repertory movement , which enabled today's  off-Broadway . A versatile and eloquent actress herself (playing roles ranging from  Peter Pan  to  Hamlet ), Le Gallienne also became a respected stage director, coach, producer and manager.
