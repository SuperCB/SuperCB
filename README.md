>Harold Bloom  (July 11, 1930 – October 14, 2019) was an American literary critic and the  Sterling Professor  of  humanities  at  Yale University . In 2017, Bloom was called "probably the most famous literary critic in the English-speaking world". After publishing his first book in 1959, Bloom wrote more than 50 books, including over 40 books of  literary criticism , several books discussing religion, and one novel. He edited hundreds of anthologies concerning numerous literary and philosophical figures for the  Chelsea House  publishing firm. This photograph by  Bernard Gotfryd  shows Bloom in 1986.
