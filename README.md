>George Norman Barnard  (December 23, 1819 – February 4, 1902) was an American photographer who was one of the first to use  daguerreotype , the first commercially available form of photography, in the United States. A fire in 1853 destroyed the  grain elevators  in  Oswego, New York , an event Barnard photographed. Historians consider these some of the first "news" photographs. Barnard also photographed  Abraham Lincoln 's  1861 inauguration . Barnard is best known for  American Civil War  era photos. He was the official army photographer for the  Military Division of the Mississippi  commanded by Union general  William T. Sherman ; his 1866 book,  Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign , showed the devastation of the war. This photograph, by  Mathew Brady , shows Barnard  c.  1865 .
