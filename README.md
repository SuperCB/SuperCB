>Fausta Labia  (1870–1935) was an Italian operatic soprano who was active mainly from 1892 to 1908. She made her debut in Naples in April 1892 as Valentine in Meyerbeer's  Les Huguenots . After engagements at the  Royal Swedish Opera  in Stockholm (1893–95) and Lisbon (1896), she returned to Italy where she performed first in Turin, Rome and Bologna. Thereafter notable performances included the title role in Mascagni's  Iris  at  La Fenice  in Venice (1900) and Sieglinde in Wagner's  Die Walküre  at Milan's  La Scala  (1901). This 1893 photograph depicts Labia while she was engaged at the Royal Swedish Opera.
