>The  European spruce bark beetle  ( Ips typographus ), is a species of  bark beetle  in the true weevil family,  Curculionidae . It is found in Europe and Asia Minor and east to China, Japan, North Korea and South Korea. Bark beetles are so named because they reproduce in the inner bark, living and dead  phloem  tissues, of trees. Their preferred trees in which to reside include  spruces ,  firs ,  pines  and  larches . The species has the ability to spread quickly over large areas and some scientists hypothesize that long-distance movements originating from the  Iberian Peninsula  may have contributed to its invasion of northern  Norway spruce  forests. This female European spruce bark beetle was photographed in  Naninne  in the province of  Namur , Belgium.
