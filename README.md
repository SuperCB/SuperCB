>Takht-i-Bahi  are the ruins of a 1st-century CE  Buddhist monastery  complex located in what was once the  ancient Indian  region of  Gandhara , in the present-day northern Pakistani province of  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . It is representative of Buddhist monastic architecture from its era and the ruins were listed as a  World Heritage Site  in 1980, with  UNESCO  describing it as having been "exceptionally well-preserved". Pictured here is an aerial view of the complex, showing its various chambers and courtyards.
