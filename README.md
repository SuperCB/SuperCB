>Sphalerite  is a  sulfide mineral  with the  chemical formula  (Zn,Fe)S. It is found in a variety of deposit types, and is found in association with  galena ,  chalcopyrite ,  pyrite  (and other sulfides),  calcite ,  dolomite ,  quartz ,  rhodochrosite , and  fluorite . Sphalerite is an important ore of  zinc , with around 95 percent of all primary zinc extracted from its ore. Due to its variable trace-element content, sphalerite is also an important source of several other metals such as  cadmium ,  gallium ,  germanium  and  indium . The zinc in sphalerite is also used to produce  brass . This sample was extracted in  Creede, Colorado , and features black tetrahedral crystals of sphalerite up to 8 mm (0.31 in) in size, with minor chalcopyrite and calcite, in a 4.5 cm × 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm (1.77 in × 1.18 in × 0.79 in)  matrix . This photograph was  focus-stacked  from 125 separate images.
