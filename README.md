>The  oak eggar  ( Lasiocampa quercus ) is a common  moth  in the family  Lasiocampidae  found in Europe and northern and western parts of Asia. The  larvae  feed on a wide variety of plant species, low down, including blackthorn, hawthorn, viburnum, dogwood, ivy and ling, but are not known to feed on oak. They can be infected by  baculoviruses , which change their behaviour and cause them to climb out of the protection of low scrub and leave them open to predation, facilitating the spread of infection. Oak eggar larvae eventually  pupate  on the ground inside a silken cocoon, the exterior of which is hard and yellowish, and resembles an  acorn , from which the common name "oak eggar" is derived. This oak eggar larva in the form of a fourth- instar  caterpillar, with a body length of 53 millimetres (2.1 inches), was photographed on a branch in  Keila , Estonia. The photograph was  focus-stacked  from 59 separate images.
