>The  Cape Barren goose  ( Cereopsis novaehollandiae ) is a species of  goose  endemic to  southern Australia . It was first formally described by English ornithologist  John Latham  in 1801. Adult Cape Barren geese are large birds, typically measuring 75 to 100 centimetres (30 to 39 inches) long and weighing between 3.7 to 5.2 kilograms (8.2 to 11.5 pounds), with males generally being larger than females. The plumage is mostly pale grey with a slight brown tint. The head is somewhat small in proportion to the body and mostly grey in colour, save for a pale whitish patch on the forehead and crown. Cape Barren geese are largely  terrestrial , only occasionally swimming. They predominantly graze on grasses,  sedges ,  legumes ,  herbs , and  succulents . This Cape Barren goose was photographed near  Karatta , on  Kangaroo Island  in  South Australia .
