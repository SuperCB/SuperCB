>PAGEOS  (Passive Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite) was a  balloon satellite  which was launched by  NASA  in 1966. It was placed into a  polar orbit  ( inclination  85–86°) with a height of approximately 4000 km, which became gradually lower during its nine years of operation. The satellite partly disintegrated in July 1975, which was followed by a second break-up that occurred in January 1976 resulting in the release of a large number of fragments. Most of these re-entered the Earth's atmosphere during the following decade. This photograph shows a test inflation of a PAGEOS satellite in a blimp hangar at  Weeksville, North Carolina , in 1965.
