>The  Duchess Anna Amalia Library  in  Weimar , Germany, houses a major collection of  German literature  and historical documents. In 1991, the tricentennial of its opening to the public, the Ducal Library was renamed for  Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel . Today, the library is a public research library for literature and art history and contains over 1,000,000 items, 150,000 of which are available for open use and borrowing. The main focus of the collection is German literature from the Classical and the late Romantic eras. The library was inscribed on  UNESCO 's list of  World Heritage Sites  as part of the  Classical Weimar  site because of its testimony to the global cultural importance of Weimar in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, during the  Weimar Classicism  movement.
