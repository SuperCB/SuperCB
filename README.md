>The  African fish eagle  ( Icthyophaga vocifer ) is a large species of  eagle  found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, wherever large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply occur. It is a  generalist species , requiring only open water with sufficient prey and a good perch, as evidenced by the number of habitat types in which this species may be found. Habitats include grasslands, swamps, marshes, tropical rainforests and  fynbos , as well as freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. Some are also found close to the coast, both at the mouths of rivers or lagoons and on desert-bordering coastline. The African fish eagle is a large bird, with females having a mass of 3.2 to 3.6 kg (7.1 to 7.9 lb), somewhat larger than the male, at 2.0 to 2.5 kg (4.4 to 5.5 lb). It breeds during the  dry season , when water levels are low and it is believed to be a  monogamous species . It is the  national bird  of Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This African fish eagle was photographed at  Lake Ziway  in Ethiopia.
