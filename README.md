>Ottmar Mergenthaler  (11 May 1854 – 28 October 1899) was the inventor of the  linotype machine , the first device that could easily and quickly set complete lines of  type  for use in  printing presses . Mergenthaler was born into a German family in  Hachtel  in the  Kingdom of Württemberg . He was apprenticed to a  watchmaker  in  Bietigheim  before emigrating to the United States in 1872 to work in  Washington, D.C. , with his cousin August Hahl. In 1876, Mergenthaler was approached by  James O. Clephane  and his associate Charles T. Moore, who sought a quicker way of publishing  legal briefs . By 1884, he conceived the idea of assembling metallic letter molds, called matrices, and  casting molten metal  into them, all within a single machine. In July 1886, the  Mergenthaler Linotype Company  installed the first commercially used Linotype in the printing office of the  New-York Tribune . This photograph shows Mergenthaler at approximately 45 years of age in 1899; he died that year in  Baltimore  of  tuberculosis .
