>Periods of heavy  rainfall  caused by multiple  atmospheric rivers  in California between December 31, 2022, and March 25, 2023,  resulted in floods  that affected parts of  Southern California , the  California Central Coast ,  Northern California  and  Nevada . The  flooding  resulted in over US$4 billion in property damage and at least 22 fatalities. A portion of  California State Route 84  in  Woodside  was closed due to  landslide  damage as a result of the floods, as shown in this aerial photograph taken on April 2, 2023.
