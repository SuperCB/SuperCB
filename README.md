>The  Royal Palace of Amsterdam  is a royal residence in  Amsterdam , Netherlands. Opened in 1655 as a  town hall , the main architect was  Jacob van Campen , who designed it in the  Dutch Baroque  style.  Louis Bonaparte  became  King of Holland  in 1806 and established his  court  in Amsterdam, turning the town hall into a palace; it has been used by  Dutch monarchs  since then, although their main place of residence is  Huis ten Bosch  in  The Hague . The Royal Palace of Amsterdam is used for entertaining and official functions during  state visits  and other official receptions, such as New Year receptions. This photograph shows the Royal Palace from  Dam Square  in 2016.
