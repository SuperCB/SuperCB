>The  buff-banded rail  ( Hypotaenidia philippensis ) is a medium-sized bird in the  rail  family, Rallidae. It comprises several subspecies found throughout much of Australasia and the south-west Pacific region, covering a range of latitudes from the  tropics  to the  subantarctic . It utilises a range of moist or wetland habitats with low, dense vegetation for cover. The buff-banded rail is a largely terrestrial bird with the size of a small domestic chicken, with mainly brown upperparts, finely banded black-and-white underparts, a white eyebrow, and a chestnut band running from the bill round the nape, with a buff band on the breast. It is an  omnivorous  scavenger that feeds on a range of terrestrial invertebrates and small vertebrates, seeds, fallen fruit and other vegetable matter, as well as carrion and refuse. This buff-banded rail was photographed in  Newington, New South Wales .
