>The  royal angelfish  ( Pygoplites diacanthus ) is a fish in the marine angelfish family,  Pomacanthidae . It is found in tropical seas, including the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean around East Africa and the Maldives, the  Tuamotus ,  New Caledonia , and the  Great Barrier Reef . It is also found around  Taiwan  and islands off the coast of Japan. The royal angelfish has a maximum length of 25.0 centimetres (9.8 inches), with coloration varying by region. A commonality is that the body is edged in narrow blue-white and orange stripes that are narrow and angle backward. It is a carnivorous species, feeding on  sponges  and  tunicates , and resides in coral-rich areas of lagoons and reefs as well as in the vicinity of caves. This royal angelfish was photographed in  Ras Muhammad National Park  on the  Sinai Peninsula  in Egypt.
