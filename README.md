>The  map  ( Araschnia levana ) is a  butterfly  of the family  Nymphalidae . It is found from Spain through Europe and east through the  Palearctic  to Central Asia and the Russian Far East to Korea and Japan. The map exhibits seasonal dimorphism which means it has two different forms, depending on whether its larva grows in the summer or the winter. The summer form ( prorsa ) has black wings, while the winter form ( levana ) – adapted for  diapause  – has red wings. Before the butterfly was fully understood, these were thought to be two different species. The eggs are laid in long strings, one on top of the other, on the underside of  stinging nettles , the larval food plant. It is thought that these strings of eggs mimic the flowers of the nettles, thereby evading predators. This map, in the  prorsa  form, was photographed in the  Piatra Craiului Mountains , Romania.
