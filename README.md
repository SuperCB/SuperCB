>Mullus barbatus , commonly known as the red mullet, is a species of  goatfish  found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the northeastern and central eastern Atlantic Ocean, where its range extends from Scandinavia southwards to Senegal, including Canary Islands, Azores and Madeira. It is a demersal fish and occurs at depths ranging from 10 to 328 m (30 to 1,000 ft) over muddy, sandy or gravel bottoms. It can grow to a standard length of 30 cm (12 in), but it is more commonly around 15 cm (6 in) long. Its snout is short and steep and there are no spines on the  operculum . The upper jaw is toothless, but there are teeth on the roof of the mouth and on the lower jaw. A pair of moderately long  barbels  on the chin do not exceed the pectoral fins in length. This fish is rose-pink, without distinctive markings on its fins. This  M. barbatus  individual was photographed in the  Arrábida Natural Park , Portugal.
