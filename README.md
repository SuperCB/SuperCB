>The  clouded Apollo  ( Parnassius mnemosyne ) is a species in the  swallowtail butterfly  family, Papilionidae, which is found in the  Palearctic realm . It is a large butterfly, which inhabits meadows and deciduous woodland clearings with plenty of flowering plants, but cannot survive in denser forest. The species has white wings, on which thin black veins are found, with blackish fringes. The forewing has two black spots. Its abdomen, antenna and legs are black. The female lays whitish conical eggs with a granular surface. This clouded Apollo male was photographed at the top of  Slivnica , in the Dinaric Alps of Slovenia.
