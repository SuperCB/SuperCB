>Sugarloaf Mountain  is a peak situated in  Rio de Janeiro , Brazil, on a peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean. Rising 396 m (1,299 ft) above the harbor, the peak is named for its resemblance to the traditional shape of concentrated refined  sugarloaf . The mountain is one of several  monolithic  granite and quartz mountains that rise straight from the water's edge in the area, and is geologically part of a family of steep-sided rock outcroppings known as  bornhardts . Sugarloaf Mountain also features the  Sugarloaf Cable Car  and is popular with tourists for its panoramic views of the city and beyond. This photograph shows Sugarloaf Mountain at sunrise viewed from  Tijuca National Park , with the Rio neighborhood of  Botafogo  in the foreground.
