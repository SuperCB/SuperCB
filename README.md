>The  brown pelican  ( Pelecanus occidentalis ) is a bird of the  pelican  family, the smallest of the eight recognized pelican species. It is found on the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from  New Jersey  to the mouth of the  Amazon River , and along the Pacific coast from  British Columbia  to northern Chile, including the Galapagos Islands. There are five recognized subspecies; the  nominate subspecies  in its breeding plumage has a white head with a yellowish wash on the crown. The  nape  and neck are dark maroon to brown. The brown pelican mainly feeds on fish, but occasionally eats  amphibians ,  crustaceans , and the  eggs  and nestlings of birds. It nests in  colonies  in secluded areas, often on islands, vegetated land among sand dunes, thickets of shrubs and trees, and  mangroves . It is recognized as the national bird of Saint Martin, Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the official state bird of the U.S. state of  Louisiana . This brown pelican in flight was photographed at  Bodega Bay , California.
