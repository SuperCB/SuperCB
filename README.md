>The  Annunciation  is an  oil painting  by the  Early Netherlandish  master  Jan van Eyck , painted around 1434–1436. Originally on  panel , the work was  transferred to canvas  in the 19th century. It is thought to have been the left (inner) wing of a  triptych , although there have been no sightings of the other wings since before 1817. The painting depicts the biblical scene of the  Annunciation , in which the  Archangel Gabriel  announces to the  Virgin Mary  that she will bear the son of God. The inscription shows his words:  AVE  GRA  PLENA  ('Hail, full of grace'). She modestly draws back and responds,  ECCE ANCILLA  DNI  ('Behold the handmaiden of the Lord'); these words appear upside down. The  Annunciation  is now in the collection of the  National Gallery of Art  in Washington, D.C.
