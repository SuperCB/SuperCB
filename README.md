>Auricularia auricula-judae , commonly known as the wood ear, the jelly ear, or historically the Jew's ear, is a species of  fungus  in the order  Auriculariales . The  basidiocarps  (fruit bodies) are brown, gelatinous, and have a noticeably ear-like shape, normally up to 90 millimetres (3.5 inches) across and up to 3 millimetres (0.12 inches) thick. It is edible but not widely consumed, and has been used as a  medicinal fungus  by  herbalists . It grows on wood, especially  elder , and is widespread throughout Europe, but is not known to occur elsewhere. The specific epithet is derived from the belief that  Judas Iscariot  hanged himself from an elder tree after  his betrayal of Jesus . These  A. auricula-judae  basidiocarps were photographed on a log in the  London Borough of Enfield .
