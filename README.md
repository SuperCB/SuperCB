>The  brown-headed cowbird  ( Molothrus ater ) is a small  cowbird  in the  icterid  family, Icteridae, native to temperate and subtropical North America. It is distinguished from other icterids by its  finch -like head and beak and its smaller size. The adult male is  iridescent  black in color with a brown head, while the adult female is slightly smaller and is dull grey with a pale throat and very fine streaking on the underparts. The brown-headed cowbird is an  obligate brood parasite , laying its eggs in the nests of other small  perching birds  and relying on those birds to raise its young. Its eggs have been documented in the nests of at least 220 host species, including  hummingbirds  and  raptors . This female brown-headed cowbird was photographed in  Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge  in New York City.
