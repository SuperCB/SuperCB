>Venus Anadyomene  is an  oil-on-canvas painting  by  Titian , dating to around 1520. It depicts the Greek goddess  Venus  rising from the sea and wringing her hair, with a shell visible at the bottom left, taken from a description of Venus by the Greek poet  Hesiod  in which she was born fully-grown from a shell. The wringing of her hair is a direct imitation of  Apelles 's lost masterwork, also called  Venus Anadyomene . The painting is in good condition and achieved public ownership in 2003 when it was purchased from  Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland . It is now in the collection of the  National Galleries of Scotland .
