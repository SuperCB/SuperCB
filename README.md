>Beulah Ream Allen  (January 26, 1897 – March 17, 1989) was an American nurse and physician. During World War II, she volunteered as a civilian surgeon for the  United States Army  and was stationed in  Baguio , where she was responsible for the care of nearly 30 soldiers, while the rest of the Army retreated to the  Bataan Peninsula . Taken prisoner in 1941, she was held in three  internment  camps before being liberated. Returning to the United States, she resumed her practice in the  San Francisco Bay Area . In 1960, she moved her practice to  Provo, Utah , where she served as the  dean  of the  Brigham Young University College of Nursing  until 1964. Allen retired in 1979 and in that year married and relocated to  Mesa, Arizona , where she lived until her death in 1989. This photograph shows Allen being awarded the  Medal of Freedom  in 1946 for her service.
