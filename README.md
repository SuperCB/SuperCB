>The  red wattlebird  ( Anthochaera carunculata ) is a  passerine  bird native to southern Australia. At 33 to 37 centimetres (13 to  14 + 1 ⁄ 2  in) in length, it is the second-largest species of Australian  honeyeater . The species is found in open forest and woodland, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It is one of the largest  nectarivorous  birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants, though insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive towards birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Although it has declined in places from  land clearing , it is classified as a  least-concern species  on the  IUCN Red List .
