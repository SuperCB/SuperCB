>The  graceful pitta  ( Erythropitta venusta ) is a species of bird in the family  Pittidae . It occurs on the Indonesian island of  Sumatra , where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist  montane forests . The graceful pitta has a length of around 18 cm (7.1 in). It is a predominantly black bird with reddish undertones, the bottom of its wings featuring vivid blue stripes while the lower breast and abdomen are crimson. It has a call which has been described as resembling a high-pitched train whistle which remains at a consistent pitch. The graceful pitta is very rare and is at risk and vulnerable. Although it has been legally protected from hunting since 1931, it is threatened by  habitat loss  as a result of deforestation. This graceful pitta was photographed in tropical rainforest at Sumatra's  Barisan Mountains .
