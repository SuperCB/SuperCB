>The  bronze-winged jacana  ( Metopidius indicus ) is a  wader  in the family  Jacanidae . It is found across South and Southeast Asia. Like other jacanas, it forages on lilies and other floating aquatic vegetation, using its long feet and legs for balance. The sexes are alike but females are slightly larger and are  polyandrous , maintaining a harem of males during the breeding season in the  monsoon  rains. Males maintain territories, with one male in the harem chosen to incubate the eggs and take care of the young. When threatened, young chicks may be carried to safety by the male under his wings. This bronze-winged jacana was photographed in  Kumarakom  on the shore of  Vembanad , the largest lake in the Indian state of  Kerala .
