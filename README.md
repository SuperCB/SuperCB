>Cerussite  is a  mineral  consisting of  lead carbonate  (PbCO 3 ), and is an important  ore  of lead. The name is from the Latin  cerussa ,  white lead .  Cerussa nativa  was mentioned by  Conrad Gessner  in 1565, and in 1832  François Sulpice Beudant  applied the name  céruse  to the mineral, while the present form,  cerussite , is due to  Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger  in 1845. Miners' names for cerussite in early use were lead-spar and white-lead-ore. In a  hydrate  form known as white lead, the mineral is a key ingredient in  lead paints  and has also been used in cosmetics, but both uses are now discontinued in many places as a result of  lead poisoning . These cerussite crystals, measuring approximately 4.0 cm × 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm (1.57 in × 1.18 in × 0.79 in), were found in a mine in  Madan-e Nakhlak , Iran.
