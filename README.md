>The Book of Fixed Stars  (Arabic:  كتاب صور الكواكب   kitāb suwar al-kawākib , literally  The Book of the Shapes of Stars ) is an  astronomical  text written by  Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi  (Azophi) around 964. Following the  Graeco-Arabic translation movement  in the 9th century AD, the book was written in  Arabic , the common language for scholars across the vast Islamic territories, although the author himself was  Persian . It was an attempt to create a synthesis of the comprehensive star catalogue in  Ptolemy 's  Almagest  (books VII and VIII) with the indigenous Arabic astronomical traditions on the  constellations  (notably the Arabic constellation system of the  Anwā ' ). The original  manuscript  no longer survives as an  autograph , however, the  Book of Stars  has survived in later-made copies. This image from the book shows the constellation of  Orion , in mirror image as if on a  celestial globe , and is from a copy in the  Bodleian Library  dated to the 12th century AD.
