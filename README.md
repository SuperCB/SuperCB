>Project Mercury  was the first  human-spaceflight  program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963. It was one of the first projects of  NASA , which was created as a response to the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of  Sputnik 1 , the first satellite in Earth orbit. The program's goals were to orbit a crewed spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. The Soviet Union won the race to put the first human into orbit when  Yuri Gagarin  traveled in  Vostok 1  in 1961, while the US launched its first astronaut on a  suborbital flight  in the same year, and achieved crewed orbital flight in 1962 when  John Glenn  made three orbits around the Earth. The Mercury project's missions were followed by millions on radio and television around the world, and it laid the groundwork for  Project Gemini , which carried two astronauts in each capsule and perfected space docking maneuvers essential for crewed  lunar landings  in the subsequent  Apollo program , announced a few weeks after the first crewed Mercury flight. This NASA illustration compares the relative sizes and launch positions of the spacecraft and rockets of Project Mercury (small) with those of Gemini (medium) and Apollo (large).
