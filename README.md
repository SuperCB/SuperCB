>Rhina Aguirre  (20 May 1939 – 30 October 2021) was a Bolivian disability activist, politician, and sociologist. An opponent of the military dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s, Aguirre was an early activist in the country's human rights movement. Exiled to Ecuador by the regime of  Luis García Meza , she collaborated with  Leonidas Proaño 's indigenous ministry and worked closely with the country's peasant and social organizations. Blinded in both eyes by  toxoplasmosis , Aguirre took up the cause of  disability rights , joining the Departmental Council for Disabled Persons upon her return to Bolivia. In 2009, she joined the  Movement for Socialism  and was elected to represent the department of  Tarija  in the  Chamber of Senators , becoming the first blind person in Bolivian history to assume a parliamentary seat. This photograph of Aguirre was taken in 2014.
