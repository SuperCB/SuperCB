>Giuseppe Arcimboldo  (1526–1593) was an  Italian Renaissance painter  best known for creating imaginative  portrait  heads made entirely of objects such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, fish and books. Born in  Milan , he initially trained as a painter under his father Biagio Arcimboldo before serving as a court painter for the  Habsburg monarchs  in  Vienna  and  Prague . Arcimboldo's oeuvre was largely forgotten after his death, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries, appearing again only in 1885 when the art critic K. Kasati published the monograph  Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist , describing his role as a portraitist. This pen-and-watercolour  self-portrait  by Arcimboldo was created in the 1570s and is now in the  National Gallery Prague .
