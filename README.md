>B-515 , sometimes known as  U-434  after her  pennant number , is a  Tango-class submarine  that served in the  Soviet Navy  and later the  Russian Navy . Built in 1976 in  Nizhny Novgorod , the submarine remained in active service until 2001. She was used for hunting, espionage, and patrol purposes, operated by a 78-man crew. Now docked in  Hamburg , Germany, she is open to the public as a  museum ship . This 2020 photograph shows a panorama of  B-515 's  interior.
