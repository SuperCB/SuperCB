>Selection on the ramp at  Auschwitz II–Birkenau  from the  Auschwitz Album , a  photographic record of the Holocaust  during  World War II . It and the  Sonderkommando  photographs  are among the small number of visual documents that show the operations of Auschwitz II–Birkenau, the German  extermination camp  in  occupied Poland .  Originally titled "Resettlement of the Jews from Hungary" ( Umsiedlung der Juden aus Ungarn ), it shows a period when the Nazis accelerated their   deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz . The images were taken by photographers from the camp's  Erkennungsdienst  ("identification service"). Among other things, the Erkennungsdienst was responsible for fingerprinting and taking photo IDs of prisoners who had not been selected for extermination. The identity of the photographers is uncertain, but it is thought to have been Bernhard Walter or Ernst Hoffmann, two  SS  men who were director and deputy director of the Erkennungsdienst. The camp's director,  Rudolf Höss , also may have taken several of the photographs himself.
