>El Tatio  is a geothermal field with many  geysers  located in the  Andes  Mountains of  northern Chile  at 4,320 metres (14,170 ft) above mean sea level. It is the third-largest geyser field in the world and the largest in the  Southern Hemisphere . The geothermal field has many geysers,  hot springs , and associated  sinter deposits . These hot springs eventually form the  Rio Salado , a major tributary of the  Rio Loa , and are a major source of  arsenic  pollution in the river. The vents are sites of populations of  extremophile  microorganisms such as  hyperthermophiles , and El Tatio has been studied as an analogue for the  early Earth  and possible past  life on Mars .
