>Avril de Sainte-Croix  (1855–1939), also known by the pen name Savioz, was a French author, journalist, feminist and pacifist. For many years she led the French branch of the  International Abolitionist Federation , which sought to abolish state regulation of prostitution and fought trafficking in women. She advised the French government and the  League of Nations  on women's issues. She was vice-president of the  International Council of Women  from 1920 and President of the  National Council of French Women  from 1922 to 1932. This photograph of de Sainte-Croix was taken by French photographer  Henri Manuel  in 1925.
