>Lord Kelvin  (26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907) was a British mathematician,  mathematical physicist  and engineer. Born in  Belfast , he was  Professor of Natural Philosophy  at the  University of Glasgow  for 53 years, where he undertook significant research, including on  electricity  and the formulation of the first and second  laws of thermodynamics . He was also the first to determine the correct value of  absolute zero , and the  Kelvin scale  of temperature is named in his honour. Kelvin received the  Copley Medal  in 1883, served as the  president of the Royal Society  from 1890 to 1895, and in 1892 became the first British scientist to be elevated to the  House of Lords . This photograph, taken circa 1900, shows Kelvin resting on a  binnacle  (the stand for a marine compass) of his invention, and holding a marine azimuth mirror.
