>The  Eurasian brown bear  ( Ursus arctos arctos ) is one of the most common  subspecies  of the brown bear, and is found in much of  Eurasia . It is also called the European brown bear, common brown bear, common bear, and colloquially by many other names. The genetic diversity of present-day brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) has been extensively studied over the years and appears to be geographically structured into five main  clades  based upon analysis of the  mitochondrial DNA . This adult female was photographed near Stari Kot,  Slovenia .
