>Cognac  is a type of  brandy  named after the commune of  Cognac  in western France. Cognac production falls under French  appellation d'origine contrôlée  (AOC) designation, which stipulates that it must be grown in a specific  wine-growing region  in the departments of  Charente  and  Charente-Maritime . The AOC also mandates that particular grapes (of which  St. Émilion  is the most common) be used, and that the drink be twice  distilled  in copper  pot stills  and aged at least two years in  oak barrels  from designated surrounding areas of France. Close to 200 cognac producers exist, of which the largest producers are  Courvoisier ,  Hennessy ,  Martell  and  Rémy Martin . This photograph shows cognac in a  snifter , a glass with a large tapered bowl and a short stem that allows the drinker to enjoy the aroma by placing their hand underneath the bowl and warming the cognac.
