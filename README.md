>Reaper  is a series of three oil-on-canvas paintings by the Dutch artist  Vincent van Gogh  of a man reaping a wheat field under a bright early-morning sun. This is the second painting in the series, which Van Gogh appears to have completed in a single day in  Saint-Rémy-de-Provence , France, while taking breaks to write a letter on 4–5 September 1889. In a later part of the letter, he announced: "Phew – the reaper is finished, I think it will be one that you'll place in your home". Van Gogh initially preferred this version over the earlier study, describing it as "an image of death as the great  Book of Nature  speaks to us about it – but what I sought is the 'almost smiling'. It's all yellow except for a line of violet hills – a pale, blond yellow. I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that through the iron bars of a cell." The painting is now in the collection of the  Van Gogh Museum  in Amsterdam.
