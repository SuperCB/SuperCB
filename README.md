>Margaret Harwood  (March 19, 1885 – February 6, 1979) was an American  astronomer  who specialized in  photometry , which involved measuring variation in the light of  stars  and  asteroids . In 1916, at 30 years old, Harwood was named director of  Maria Mitchell Observatory , and worked there until her retirement in 1957. In 1917, she discovered the asteroid  886 Washingtonia  four days before its formal recognition, but was advised not to report it because it would have been inappropriate for a woman to do so. In 1923, she became the first woman to gain access to the  Mount Wilson Observatory , and in 1924 was the first woman allowed to use  the observatory's 60-inch telescope , the largest in the world at the time. In 1960, an asteroid discovered at  Palomar  was named in her honor as  7040 Harwood . This photograph of Harwood is in the archives of the  Smithsonian Institution .
