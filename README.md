>Cholatse  is a mountain in the  Khumbu  region of the Nepalese Himalayas. It has an elevation of 6,440 metres (21,130 ft) above sea level. Cholatse is connected to the slightly higher  Taboche  by a long ridge. The Chola  glacier  descends off the east face. A lake is located to the east, which gave the mountain its name – in  Tibetan ,  cho  means 'lake',  la  means 'pass', and  tse  means 'peak'. Cholatse was first climbed via the southwest ridge in 1982. The north and east faces of the mountain can be seen from  Dughla , on the trail to the  Everest base camp . This photograph of Cholatse was taken from the east, near Dughla, with a small section of Chola Lake visible in the centre of the image. The  terminal moraine  of the glacier can be seen in the foreground.
