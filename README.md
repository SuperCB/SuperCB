>Trillium erectum , the red trillium, is a species of  flowering plant  in the family  Melanthiaceae . It is a spring  ephemeral plant  whose life-cycle is synchronized with that of the forests in which it lives. It is native to the eastern United States and eastern Canada from northern  Georgia  to  Quebec  and  New Brunswick . Like all trilliums, it has a  whorl  of three  bracts  (leaves) and a single  trimerous  flower with three  sepals , three  petals , two whorls of three  stamens  each, and three  carpels  (fused into a single  ovary  with three  stigmas ). It is a  perennial  plant that persists by means of an underground  rhizome .  Trillium erectum  has  carrion-scented flowers  that produce fetid or putrid odors purported to attract carrion fly and beetle pollinators. This  T. erectum  flower was photographed in  Stephen's Gulch Conservation Area  in  Ontario , Canada.
