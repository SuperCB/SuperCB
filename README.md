>Gina Krog  (20 June 1847 – 14 April 1916) was a Norwegian  suffragist , teacher, liberal politician, writer and editor. She played a central role in the Norwegian  women's movement  from the 1880s until her death, notably as a leading campaigner for women's  right to vote . In 1884, Krog co-founded the  Norwegian Association for Women's Rights  with liberal MP  Hagbart Berner . Over the next two decades, Krog co-founded the  Women's Voting Association , the  National Association for Women's Suffrage , and the  Norwegian National Women's Council , spearheading the presentation of women's suffrage proposals to the  Storting  (the Norwegian parliament). She was an early member of the  Liberal Party  and served as a deputy member of its national board. Krog was regarded as an unapologetic liberal progressive during her time, seeking full and equal voting rights for all women on the same conditions as men, which was achieved in 1913.  She was the first woman in Norway to receive a state funeral.
