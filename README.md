>Franklin D. Roosevelt  (January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945) was the 32nd  president of the United States , serving from 1933 until his death. He was the longest-serving U.S. president and the only one to serve more than two terms in office. His first two terms were centered on combating the  Great Depression , while his third and fourth saw him shift his focus to  America's involvement in World War II . This official photographic portrait of Roosevelt was taken in  Hyde Park, New York , for his  1944 presidential election  campaign.
