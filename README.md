>Bispira volutacornis , sometimes known as the twin fan worm or spiral fan worm, is a type of  tube worm  found in the shallow  sublittoral zone  of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It grows in crevices and in stony areas and prefers areas rich in sediment but with low levels of illumination. It has a parchment-like tube with a  mucoid  outer layer that is often coated with mud or silt. The tube is usually concealed in a crevice and the worm can retract into the tube when disturbed. It feeds on plankton which it captures with its plumes. It also uses the plumes to gather sediment with which to expand the tube. This  B. volutavornis  worm was photographed in  Arrábida Natural Park , Portugal.
