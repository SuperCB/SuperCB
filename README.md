>Chartres Cathedral , also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres, is a Catholic  cathedral  in  Chartres , France, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of  Paris . It is the seat of the  bishop of Chartres . Mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands on the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the  Diocese of Chartres  was formed as an  episcopal see  in the 4th century. It is one of the best-known and most influential examples of  High Gothic  and  Classic Gothic  architecture. Chartres Cathedral is known for its  stained glass , and contains  167 stained-glass windows  dating from the 12th century to the 20th century. This photograph shows the stained glass in the north  transept  of Chartres Cathedral. The  rose window , which is 10.5 metres (34 feet) in diameter, was installed circa 1230 and contains imagery relating to the  Virgin Mary  and figures from the  Old Testament . The presence of the  coats of arms  of  King Louis IX  and his mother  Blanche of Castile  are taken as a sign of royal patronage for this window. Below the rose are five  lancet windows , each 7.5 metres (25 feet) tall, depicting  Saint Anne  and four Old Testament figures.
