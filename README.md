>Philippe Chaperon  (1823–1906) was a French painter and  scenic designer , particularly known for his work at the  Paris Opera . He produced stage designs for the premieres of numerous 19th-century operas, including Verdi's  Don Carlos  and  Aida , Massenet's  Le Cid , Saint-Saëns's  Henry VIII , part two of Berlioz's  Les Troyens , and the first performances in France of Verdi's  Otello  and  Rigoletto  and Wagner's  Tannhäuser . His painting style was influenced by his architecture studies, such as his debut work exhibited at the  Paris Salon ,  Ruines d'un Temple dans l'Inde . This photographic portrait of Chaperon, taken around 1900, was produced by the studio (a.k.a.  atelier ) of the French photographer  Nadar .
