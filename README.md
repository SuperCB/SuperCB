>The  Green–Meldrim House  is a historic house at 14 West Macon Street, on the northwest corner of  Madison Square , in  Savannah, Georgia . Built in 1853, it was designated a  National Historic Landmark  in 1976. The house is owned by the adjacent  St. John's Church , which offers tours and uses it as a meeting and reception space. This 1864 sketch by  William Waud  depicts the entrance hall of the Green–Meldrim House, which was then in use by General  William Tecumseh Sherman  as his headquarters during the  American Civil War . Waud's illustration was adapted into an  engraving  for the January 21, 1865, issue of  Harper's Weekly .
