>Portrait of Margaret van Eyck  is a 1439  oil-on-wood painting  by the  Early Netherlandish  artist  Jan van Eyck . A portrait of his wife Margaret, it is one of the two latest of van Eyck's surviving paintings, and one of the earliest European artworks to depict a painter's spouse. It was completed when Margaret was around 34 and hung until the early 18th century in the chapel of the guild of painters in  Bruges  (in present-day Belgium). The work is thought to be a  pendant  or a  diptych  panel, with van Eyck himself occupying the other half in either a now lost self-portrait known from records until 1769, or his  Portrait of a Man . This portrait of Margaret is now in the collection of the  Groeningemuseum  in Bruges.
