>The  saung , also known as the  saung-gauk  or the Burmese harp, is an arched  harp  used in traditional  Burmese music . It is regarded as the national musical instrument of Myanmar. It was possibly introduced as early as 500 AD from southeastern India, based on archaeological evidence of Burmese temple reliefs that depict a long-necked harp similar to depictions found in  Bengal . The earliest evidence of the  saung  itself is at the  Bawbawgyi Pagoda  near present-day  Prome . At that site, there is a mid-600s sculptured relief depicting the arched harp with about five strings, appearing with musicians and a dancer. It has survived continuously since that time, and has been mentioned in many texts, pictorial representations and  Bagan  temples.  Burmese chronicles  describe harps in ceremonial ensembles at medieval Pagan, and female harpists who performed for royals. This 19th-century  saung  is in the collection of the  Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York City.
