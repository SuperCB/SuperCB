>Great Yarmouth Town Hall  is a municipal building on Hall Plain in  Great Yarmouth , in  Norfolk , England. It is the meeting place of  Great Yarmouth Borough Council  and is a Grade II*  listed building . The town hall was designed by  John Bond Pearce  in the  Queen Anne Revival style , with  terracotta  facings and a 110-foot-tall (34-metre)  clock tower  with a  lantern  above. It was opened by  Edward, Prince of Wales  (later King Edward VII), on 31 May 1882. The building served as the headquarters of Great Yarmouth County Borough Council for much of the 20th century and has continued to operate as the local seat of government following the formation of the enlarged borough council in 1974.
