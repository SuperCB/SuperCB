>John C. Dancy  (1857–1920) was an American politician, journalist, and educator. For many years he was the editor of  African Methodist Episcopal  newspapers  Star of Zion  and then  Zion Quarterly . In 1897 he was appointed collector of customs at  Wilmington, North Carolina , but was chased out of town in the  Wilmington massacre  of 1898, in part for his activity in the  National Afro-American Council  which he helped found and of which he was an officer. He then moved to  Washington, D.C. , where he served as  recorder of deeds  from 1901 to 1910. His political appointments came in part as a result of the influence of his ally,  Booker T. Washington .
