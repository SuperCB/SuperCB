>Billy Bowlegs  (real name: Holata Micco, meaning  Alligator Chief ) (c. 1810 – 1859) was an important leader of the  Seminoles  in  Florida  during the  Second Seminole War . He was the remaining Seminoles' most prominent chief during the  Third Seminole War , in which he led the Seminoles' last major resistance against the United States government. With the possibilities of military victory dwindling, he finally agreed to relocate with his people to  Indian Territory  (present-day  Oklahoma ) in 1858. As part of the settlement he was paid $6,500 plus $1,000 each for the subchiefs and $100 each for the women and children who went with him. This  lithograph  of Bowlegs was produced by an unknown engraver in around 1865–1870, based on an original work by  Julian Vannerson .
