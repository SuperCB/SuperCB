>Filipendula vulgaris , commonly known as dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the family  Rosaceae  and closely related to  meadowsweet . Found in Europe, western Siberia, Asia Minor, the Caucasus and North Africa, it has finely cut, fern-like radical leaves that form a basal rosette, and an erect stem 20 to 50 centimetres (8 to 20 inches) tall. The flowers appear in dense clusters, and the plant has an overall height of 50 to 100 centimetres (20 to 40 inches), achieved after two to five years, and a spread of around about 10 to 50 centimetres (4 to 20 inches). The plant thrives on chalk and limestone downs, and on heaths on other basic rocks, with full sun or partial shade, and is tolerant of dry conditions. This  F. vulgaris   inflorescence  was photographed in  Kulna , Estonia. The photograph was  focus-stacked  from 26 separate images.
