>The  pomegranate  ( Punica granatum ) is a  fruit -bearing  deciduous  shrub in the family  Lythraceae  that grows between 5 and 10 metres (16 and 33 feet) tall. The pomegranate fruit  husk  is red-purple in color, with an outer, hard pericarp, and an inner, spongy mesocarp (white "albedo"), which comprises the fruit inner wall where seeds attach. Pomegranate seeds are characterized by having  sarcotesta , thick fleshy seed coats derived from the integuments or outer layers of the ovule's  epidermal  cells. The number of seeds in a fruit can vary from 200 to about 1,400. Rich in symbolic and mythological associations in many cultures, the pomegranate is thought to have originated from Afghanistan and Iran before being introduced and exported to other parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. This photograph, which was  focus-stacked  from 10 separate images, shows a whole pomegranate fruit (right), and a fruit split open to reveal the  arils , each of which surrounds a seed (left).
