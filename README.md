>The  green iguana  ( Iguana iguana ), also known as the American iguana, the common green iguana, or simply the iguana, is a large,  arboreal , mostly  herbivorous  species of  lizard  of the genus  Iguana . The species is native to a large geographic area, from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico. It grows to 1.7 metres (5.6 feet) in length from head to tail, although a few specimens have grown more than 2 metres (6.6 feet) with weights upward of 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms). Green iguanas possess a row of spines along their backs and tails, which helps to protect them from predators. Their whip-like tails can be used to deliver painful strikes, and like many other lizards, when grabbed by the tail, iguanas can  allow it to break , so they can escape and eventually regenerate a new one. This green iguana was photographed in  Palm Beach County, Florida , where the species has been  introduced .
