>Sargocentron xantherythrum , commonly known as the Hawaiian squirrelfish or striped squirrelfish, is a member of the  squirrelfish  family that is endemic to the  Hawaiian Islands . Growing to a length of 17 centimeters (6.7 in), the fish has a red coloration with white stripes running along the body, as well as sharp gill spines and rough scales that can cause the fish to be snagged in netting materials. It is a  nocturnal species  that is much more active at night. It inhabits seaward reefs below the surge zone, and is common near caves and ledges, feeding mainly on worms, crustaceans and starfish. It occasionally makes its way into the  aquarium  trade. This school of  S. xantherythrum  was photographed in the  French Frigate Shoals , part of the  Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument  in  Hawaii .
