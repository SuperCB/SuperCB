>Ernest Shackleton  (15 February 1874 – 5 January 1922) was an explorer who led three British expeditions to the  Antarctic  during the  Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . He and three companions established a new record  Farthest South  latitude, 112 miles (180 km) from the  South Pole , as part of the  Nimrod  Expedition  of 1907–1909; Shackleton was  knighted  on his return home. He planned the  Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition  of 1914–1917 but his ship,  Endurance , became trapped in  pack ice  and then sank on 21 November 1915. The crew escaped and used the lifeboats to reach  Elephant Island  and ultimately the island of  South Georgia  in a stormy ocean voyage of more than 700 nautical miles (800 mi; 1,300 km), Shackleton's most famous exploit. He returned to the Antarctic in 1921 with the  Shackleton–Rowett Expedition  but died of a heart attack on South Georgia, where he was buried at his wife's request. This photograph of Shackleton was taken by  George Charles Beresford  before 1909.
