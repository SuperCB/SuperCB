>The  eastern quoll  ( Dasyurus viverrinus ) is a medium-sized carnivorous  marsupial  in the  dasyurid  family, and one of six extant species of  quolls . Endemic to Australia, the species occurs on the island of  Tasmania , and was formerly found across much of southeastern mainland Australia before becoming functionally extinct there in the 1960s. Eastern quolls are about the size of a small  domestic cat  and have a thick, light fawn or near-black, coat with white spots. They are solitary predators, hunting at night for their prey of insects, small mammals, birds, and reptiles. This fawn- morph  eastern quoll was photographed in  Upper Esk , Tasmania.
