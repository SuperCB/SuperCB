>The  pied kingfisher  ( Ceryle rudis ) is a species of  water kingfisher  widely distributed across Africa and Asia. Originally described by  Carl Linnaeus  in 1758, it has five recognised subspecies. Its black and white plumage and crest, as well as its habit of hovering over clear lakes and rivers before diving for fish, make it distinctive. Males have a double band across the breast, while females have a single broken breast band. They are usually found in pairs or small family groups. When perched, they often bob their head and flick up their tail. This male pied kingfisher of the subspecies  C. r. leucomelanurus  was photographed by the  Chambal River  in  Uttar Pradesh , India.
