>A Peculiar Family  is an 1865 comedy musical play by the English writer  William Brough  featuring music by  Thomas German Reed . The play starred German Reed, his wife  Priscilla , and  John Parry . It premiered in 1865 at the German Reeds' London theatre, the  Royal Gallery of Illustration , and is part of a multi-decade series known as the  German Reed Entertainments . The play is set in a French coastal hotel and features the eponymous family: Barnaby Bounce, his sister, Cherry, two of his nephews and a grandfather, along with a German detective named Herr Von Doppelslich, the French landlady and a countess. The story involves a mix-up over a white hat worn by Barnaby and the hat's owner, who is being pursued by Von Doppelslich. This poster for  A Peculiar Family  was designed by Robert Jacob Hamerton.
