>Baryte  is a mineral consisting of  barium sulfate  (BaSO 4 ). Generally white or colorless, it is the main source of the element  barium , an  alkaline earth metal . It is found across the world and can be deposited through biogenic and hydrothermal processes or evaporation. Early records of baryte date to the 16th century, when a radiating form gained notoriety among  alchemists  for specimens found near  Bologna , Italy.  Carl Wilhelm Scheele  determined that baryte contained a new element in 1774, but elemental barium was not isolated until 1808 by  Humphry Davy , using electrolysis of molten barium salts. Modern uses of baryte include oil and gas drilling, oxygen and sulfur isotopic analysis, and  radiometric dating . These crystals of baryte on a  dolomite  crystal  matrix  was found at Cerro Warihuyn in  Miraflores District , Peru. This photograph was  focus-stacked  from 24 separate images.
