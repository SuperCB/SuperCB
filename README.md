>The  Bali myna  ( Leucopsar rothschildi ) is a medium-sized bird in the  starling  family, Sturnidae. It is found in the north-west of the Indonesian island of  Bali , and nearby offshore islands. The Bali myna has a length of around 25 centimetres (9.8 inches) and is almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. It has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow beak. Both sexes are similar. The species is  critically endangered  and fewer than 50 adults were assumed to exist in the wild in 2020. This Bali myna perching on a branch was photographed in  West Bali National Park .
