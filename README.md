>Laocoön and His Sons  is an ancient sculpture which was excavated in  Rome , Italy, in 1506. It depicts the  Trojan  priest  Laocoön  and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents. The figures in the statue are nearly life-sized, with the entire group measuring just over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in height. The statue is likely to be the same one that received praise from the Roman writer  Pliny the Elder , who attributed the work (then housed in the palace of the emperor  Titus ) to three Greek sculptors from the island of  Rhodes :  Agesander , Athenodoros and Polydorus, but he did not mention the work's date or patron. Modern scholars are not certain of the work's origins; it might be an original work or a copy of an earlier bronze sculpture. After its discovery,  Laocoön and His Sons  was put on public display in the  Vatican Museums , where it remains.
