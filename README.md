>The  golden-fronted woodpecker  ( Melanerpes aurifrons ) is a species of bird in the  woodpecker  family, Picidae. It is found in the southern United States, Mexico and parts of Central America. It inhabits  mesic  and  xeric  landscapes, including mesquite brushlands and  riparian  woodlands. It can also be found in urban parks and suburban areas. Males and females have the same plumage except for the pattern on their heads. Adult males have a red crown and a golden orange to yellow nape with a gap between them; females have a grayish crown and a paler yellow nape. The golden-fronted woodpecker has a diet of adult and larval arthropods, some aerial insects, fruit, nuts and corn, as well as occasionally eating other birds' eggs. The bird has a loud  call  and a short, slow drumming pattern. This male golden-fronted woodpecker was photographed perching on a branch in  Copán , Honduras.
