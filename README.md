>This famous design, by  Roger Kastel , of a shark with a mouth filled with jagged teeth, rising towards an unsuspecting female swimmer, was completed in 1974. Its first appearance was as a book cover ( illustrated as the image accompanying  Today's Featured Article ) with publication of the paperback edition of  the novel  by  Peter Benchley , on January 1, 1975. Later that year, it formed the basis for one of the most iconic film posters in history ( shown here ) with the release of  the movie  on June 20, 1975. In 2014, the Review Board of the  United States Copyright Office  upheld the denial of a copyright for the artwork as there was no proper notice of copyright, since the only copyright notice in the paperback was that of Benchley's 1974 copyright of the text.
