>Agelena labyrinthica  is a species of spider in the family  Agelenidae . It builds a flat-plate surface web connected to a funnel-shaped retreat similar to a  labyrinth , typically between low-lying grass and vegetation. These webs can be at ground level, or up to 1.5 metres (5 ft) from the ground. The species is fairly common in Europe, and is typically concentrated in areas near forests and low-lying vegetation, as well as in dry grassland. This female  A. labyrinthica  spider was photographed in a funnel web in Blankaart Nature Reserve near  Diksmuide , Belgium. She has lost one leg, which is trapped in the web.
