>Webb's First Deep Field  is the first  operational image  taken by the  James Webb Space Telescope , captured by the telescope's  Near-Infrared Camera  (NIRCam) and revealed to the public by  NASA  in July 2022. The  deep-field  photograph, which covers a tiny area of sky visible from the  Southern Hemisphere , is centered on  SMACS 0723 , a galaxy cluster in the constellation of  Volans . Thousands of galaxies are visible in the image, some as old as 13 billion years and when it was released it became the highest-resolution image of the  early universe  ever taken.
