>The  Three Brothers  was a piece of jewellery created in the late 14th century that consisted of three rectangular red  spinels  arranged around a central  diamond . It was known for having been owned by a number of important historical figures. After its commission by  John the Fearless ,  Duke of Burgundy , the Three Brothers was part of the  Burgundian  crown jewels for almost 100 years before passing into the possession of the German banker  Jakob Fugger . The jewel was eventually sold to  King Edward VI  and became part of the  Crown Jewels of England  from 1551 to 1643. It was worn prominently by  Queen Elizabeth I  and  King James I . In the early 1640s,  Henrietta Maria , the wife of  King Charles I , attempted to sell the jewel to raise funds for the  English Civil War , but it is unclear if she succeeded. Its whereabouts after 1645 remain unknown. This miniature painting of the Three Brothers, drawn at a scale of 1:1, was commissioned by the city of  Basel  to serve as an inventory but also as an advertisement to potential buyers around 1500.
