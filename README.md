>Ptychochromis insolitus , also known as the Mangarahara cichlid, is a species of  cichlid , a fish in the family Cichlidae.  Endemic  to certain river systems in northern Madagascar, it can reach a length of 26 centimetres (10 inches) and features long tooth- or comb-like structures known as cteni on many of its scales. This unusual feature contributed to the decision to use the species name  insolitus  when the fish was  first described as a new species  in 2006. It is classified as a  critically endangered  animal, being threatened by habitat loss and competition from  introduced species ; after the last known female was killed during a breeding attempt, its conservation received significant international attention as  London Zoo  launched a media campaign to identify any remaining individuals. A remnant population was discovered in 2013, and breeding programs in Madagascar and at  Toronto Zoo  have resulted in thousands of successful hatchlings. This  P. insolitus  fish was photographed in  Wilhelma , a botanical garden in  Stuttgart , Germany.
