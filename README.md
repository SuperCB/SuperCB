>Christ Crowned with Thorns , sometimes known as  Christ Mocked , is an  oil-on-panel  painting by  Hieronymus Bosch . It is held in the  National Gallery  in London, which dates it to around 1510, though some art historians prefer earlier dates. The painting combines two events from the biblical account of the  Passion : the  mocking of Jesus  and the  crowning with thorns . A serene  Jesus , dressed in white at the centre of the busy scene, gazes calmly out of the picture, in contrast with the violent intent of the four men around him. Two armoured soldiers stand above and behind him, with two other spectators kneeling below and in front. The soldier to the right, with  oak  leaves in his hat and a spiked collar, grasps Jesus's shoulder, while the other soldier to the left, dressed in green with a broad-headed hunting  crossbow bolt  through his headdress, holds the crown of thorns in a mailed hand, about to thrust it onto Jesus's head. The position of the crown of thorns creates a halo above the head of Jesus. In front, the man to the left has a blue robe and red head covering, and the man to the right in a light red robe is grasping Christ's cloak to strip it off. The figures are crowded together in a small space in a single plane, in a manner reminiscent of  Flemish devotional art  of the type popularized by  Hans Memling  and  Hugo van der Goes .
