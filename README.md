>Al-Wakwak  is an island, or possibly more than one island, in  medieval Arabic geographical  and imaginative literature. Sources variously identify al-Wakwak as representing Japan, Madagascar,  Sumatra  or  Java , with others describing it as an island in the  China Sea  ruled by a queen with an entirely female population. This painting in watercolor and gold on paper was created in  Mughal India  in the early 1600s, and depicts a plant that brings forth animal life in multiple forms, derived from a conflation of medieval Persian and Quranic sources, including descriptions of al-Wakwak as inhabited by half-plant and half-animal creatures. The work is now in the collection of the  Cleveland Museum of Art  in Ohio.
