>Margaret Hamilton   (December 9, 1902 – May 16, 1985) was an American entertainer and educator, with a fifty-year career in entertainment spanning theater, film, radio and television. She was best known for her portrayal of the  Wicked Witch of the West  and her Kansas counterpart Almira Gulch in the 1939  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  film  The Wizard of Oz . A former schoolteacher, she worked as a  character actress  in films for seven years before she was offered the role that defined her public image. In later years, Hamilton appeared in films and made frequent cameo appearances on television  sitcoms  and  commercials . She also gained recognition for her work as an advocate of causes designed to benefit children and animals and retained a lifelong commitment to public education.
