>The  Atari video game burial  was a 1983 mass burial of unsold  video game cartridges , consoles, and computers, undertaken by the American video game and home computer company  Atari, Inc. , at a landfill site in the U.S. state of  New Mexico . The burial occurred amid the  video game crash of 1983 , at the end of a disastrous fiscal year that saw Atari being sold off by its parent company  Warner Communications . It included 700,000 cartridges of various games, including unsold copies of  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial  (1982), one of the  largest video game failures in history . For several decades after the burial was first reported, there were doubts as to its veracity and scope, and it was frequently dismissed as an  urban legend . In 2013 and 2014, an excavation was carried out by  Fuel Industries ,  Microsoft , the New Mexico government and others, which revealed discarded games and hardware. Only a small fraction, about 1,300 cartridges, were recovered, with a portion reserved for curation and the rest auctioned to raise money for a museum to commemorate the burial. This photograph shows  packaging  for cartridges of the video games  E.T.  and  Centipede  in situ at the excavation site.
