>Stephanolepis hispidus , commonly known as the planehead filefish, is a species in the  filefish  family, Monacanthidae. It is found in the Atlantic Ocean at depths of up to 300 metres (980 ft), with its range extending from the Canadian province of Nova Scotia to Uruguay in the west and from the Canary Islands to Angola in the east. It lives near the seabed on reefs and over sandy and muddy sea floors, often being found among  Sargassum  seaweed.  Stephanolepis hispidus  grows to a maximum length of 27 centimetres (11 in) but is more typically about 17 centimetres (6.7 in) long. The colour is cryptic, being a more or less mottled pale brown, olive or green on a light coloured background, sometimes with darker brown splotches and streaks. This  S. hispidus  individual was photographed off the Spanish island of  Tenerife .
