>The  Phaistos Disc  is a disc of fired  clay  from the Greek island of  Crete , dating possibly from the middle or late  Minoan  Bronze Age (second millennium BC). It bears a text on both sides in an unknown script and language, and its purpose and original place of manufacture remain disputed. Discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist  Luigi Pernier , the disc is made of fine-grained clay, intentionally and properly fired, and is approximately cylindrical with a diameter of around 16 centimetres (6.3 inches) and a thickness of almost 2 centimetres (0.79 inches), with rounded edges. The disc is an early example of  movable-type  printing, with the embossed signs that comprise its inscription resulting from separate stamps that were pressed into the soft clay before firing. It has captured the imagination of amateur and professional  palaeographers , and  many attempts have been made  to decipher the text, which comprises 241 occurrences of 45 distinct signs. The Phaistos Disc is now on display at the  Heraklion Archaeological Museum  on Crete.
