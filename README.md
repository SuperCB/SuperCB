>Orson Welles  (May  6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer who is remembered for his innovative work in film, radio, and theatre. After various theatre roles in Ireland, England and the United States as well as acting on radio shows, Welles began directing stage productions for the  Federal Theatre Project  at the age of 21. These included the  Voodoo  Macbeth  (1936) and  The Cradle Will Rock  (1937). His first film was  Citizen Kane  (1941),  which he co-wrote , produced, directed and starred in as the title character,  Charles Foster Kane . It has been consistently ranked as  one of the greatest films ever made . Welles directed twelve other features, including  The Magnificent Ambersons  (1942),  The Lady from Shanghai  (1947),  Othello  (1951),  Touch of Evil  (1958),  The Trial  (1962),  Chimes at Midnight  (1966), and  F for Fake  (1973). Welles's distinctive directorial style featured layered and  nonlinear narrative  forms, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio,  deep focus  shots and  long takes . He received an  Academy Award  and three  Grammy Awards , among other honors. This photograph, taken in 1938, shows Welles surrounded by reporters and discussing his radio drama " The War of the Worlds ", which had induced panic among some listeners who believed that a real  Martian  invasion was taking place.
