>The  Victorious Youth  is a  Greek bronze sculpture  created between 300 and 100 BCE. It is currently displayed at the  Getty Villa , a museum in  Pacific Palisades, California . The sculpture was found in the summer of 1964 in the sea off  Fano  on the Adriatic coast of Italy, snagged in the nets of an Italian fishing trawler. In 1977, the  J. Paul Getty Museum  purchased the bronze.  Bernard Ashmole , an archaeologist and art historian, was asked to inspect the sculpture by Munich art dealer Heinz Herzer; Ashmole and other scholars attributed it to  Lysippos , a prolific sculptor of  Classical Greek art . The research and conservation of the  Victorious Youth  dates from the 1980s to the 1990s and is based on studies in classical bronzes by ancient Mediterranean specialists in collaboration with the Getty Museum. Scholars have various theories as to the identity of the subject, the least controversial of which is that the figure was an  ancient Olympic  runner who held a victor's  palm branch  in his left arm. His right hand reaches to touch the winner's  olive wreath  on his head.
