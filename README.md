>The  Neue Nationalgalerie  is a museum for  modern art  in Berlin, Germany, with its main focus on the 20th century. It is part of the  National Gallery  of the  Berlin State Museums . The museum building and its sculpture gardens were designed by  Ludwig Mies van der Rohe  and opened in 1968, with a modernist design and constructed largely from steel and glass. Neue Nationalgalerie serves as a repository for a notable collection of 20th-century European art. Its holdings include masterpieces by prominent figures such as  Pablo Picasso ,  Wassily Kandinsky ,  Ernst Ludwig Kirchner , and  Joan Miró . The gallery closed in 2015 for renovation works, and reopened in August 2021 with an exhibition of works by American sculptor  Alexander Calder . This photograph is a view of the western and southern façades of the building, with Calder's sculpture  Têtes et Queue  in the foreground.
