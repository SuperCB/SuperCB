>Walter Q. Gresham  (1832–1895) was an American attorney, jurist, statesman, and politician who served in the cabinets of presidents  Chester A. Arthur  and  Grover Cleveland . He was the 31st  United States postmaster general  under Arthur from 1883 to 1884 and briefly then the 35th  secretary of the treasury  from September to October 1884 before resigning to become a federal judge. He was twice a candidate for the  Republican  nomination for president in 1884 and 1888 before leaving the party to support Cleveland in the  1892 election . He joined Cleveland's second cabinet as the 33rd  U.S. secretary of state  from 1893 until his death in 1895. Gresham served as a federal judge on the  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , the  circuit courts for the Seventh Circuit , and the  district court for the District of Indiana . This  line engraving  of Gresham was produced around 1902 by the Department of the Treasury's  Bureau of Engraving and Printing , as part of  a presentation album  of the first 42 secretaries of the treasury.
