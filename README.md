>Sigmaringen Castle , located in  Sigmaringen , Baden-Württemberg, Germany, served as the princely castle and seat of government for the princes of  Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen . First mentioned in 1077, it was rebuilt around 1200 and suffered various fires through the centuries, most recently around 1893 when the eastern wing was destroyed. It then underwent a full rebuild in eclectic style (a combination of  Romanesque ,  Gothic , and mostly  Renaissance ). During the closing months of World War II, Sigmaringen Castle was  briefly the seat  of the  Vichy French government  after  France was liberated by the Allies . The castle is still owned by the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family, and is open to visitors. This photograph was taken from the north west, across the  Danube  river.
