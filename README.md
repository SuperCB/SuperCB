>Jeremiah Gurney  (1812–1895) was an American  daguerreotype  photographer. Initially working in the jewelry trade in  Saratoga, New York , he took up photography after learning of daguerreotype from  Samuel Morse , moving to New York City where he began selling photographs alongside jewelry. He was one of the earliest photographers in the city, and may have been the owner of the first photographic gallery in the United States. Gurney took this self-portrait photograph around 1869, now in the collection of the  Minneapolis Institute of Art .
