>The  Sonoma chipmunk  ( Neotamias sonomae ) is a species of  rodent  in the  squirrel  family, Sciuridae. It is endemic to the U.S. state of  California , north of  San Francisco Bay , with most of its range within  Sonoma County  and  Marin County . The species is found in areas of  coniferous  forests such as  sticky laurel  and  ponderosa pine , as well as in  chaparral , particularly  sagebrush plains . Its range includes elevations from sea level to 1800 meters (5,900 ft). The chipmunk typically lives on the ground and makes  burrows , but can also climb and may make nests in trees. Like other members of the  Neotamias  genus, it has two  premolars . This Sonoma chipmunk was photographed in  Samuel P. Taylor State Park  in Marin County, California.
