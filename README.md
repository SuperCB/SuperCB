>Agrius cingulata , commonly known as the pink-spotted hawkmoth or sweetpotato hornworm, is a  moth  in the family  Sphingidae . The species was first described by  Johan Christian Fabricius  in 1775. It has a wide range throughout the Americas, with adults migrating north to Canada and south to  Patagonia  and the  Falkland Islands . It can also be found in the  Galápagos Islands  and  Hawaii , and has been found in western Europe and West Africa. A  nocturnal  insect,  A. cingulata  feeds on the nectar from deep-throated flowers including  moonflower ,  morning glories  and  petunia . Its  larva  is a large, stout  caterpillar  with a horn, which feeds during the day and the night on  sweet potato ,  Datura , and other plants. This male  A. cingulata  moth was photographed in the Mount Totumas cloud forest in Panama.
