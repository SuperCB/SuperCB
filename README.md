>Acer negundo , also known as the box elder, is a species of  maple  in the family  Sapindaceae , native to North America. It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, ash-like compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or  invasive species , and has been  naturalized  throughout much of the world. It grows up to 10 to 25 metres (35 to 80 feet) tall, with a trunk diameter of 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20 inches). Male and female flowers appear on separate plants, with flowers on male plants generally appearing in clusters of four and flowers on female plants appearing as a  raceme . These flowers of a female  A. negundo  plant were photographed in  Keila , Estonia.
