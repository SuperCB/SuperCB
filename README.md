>The  Battle of Inab , also called the Battle of Ard al-Hâtim or Fons Muratus, was fought on 29 June 1149 during the  Second Crusade . The  Zengid  army of  Nur al-Din Zengi  destroyed the combined army of  Raymond of Poitiers  and the  Assassins  of Ali ibn-Wafa. The  Principality of Antioch  was subsequently pillaged and reduced in size as its eastern border was pushed west, and both Raymond and his ally ibn-Wafa were killed. This illustration by  Jean Colombe  was taken from the 14th-century manuscript  Passages d'outremer  and depicts the Battle of Inab in the main image above, with the recovery of Raymond's body depicted below. It is part of a volume of 66 such full-page miniatures.
