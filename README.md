>The  Holmdel Horn Antenna  is a large microwave  horn antenna  that was used as a  satellite communication  antenna and  radio telescope  during the 1960s at  Bell Telephone Laboratories  in  Holmdel Township, New Jersey , United States. It was designated a  National Historic Landmark  in 1988 because of its association with the research work of two  radio astronomers ,  Arno Penzias  and  Robert Wilson , who used it to discover the  cosmic microwave background radiation  (CMBR) that permeates the universe. This helped change the science of cosmology, the study of the history of the universe, from a field for unlimited theoretical speculation into a discipline of direct observation. In 1978, Penzias and Wilson received the  Nobel Prize in Physics  for their discovery.
