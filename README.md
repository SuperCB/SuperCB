>The  short-beaked echidna  ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) is one of four living species of  echidna . It is covered in fur and  spines , has a distinctive  snout  to help detect its surroundings, and uses a specialized  tongue  to catch insects. Its extremely strong front limbs and claws allow it to burrow quickly. It repels  predators  by  curling into a ball  and deters them with its spines. During the Australian winter, it goes into deep  torpor  and  hibernation . As the temperature increases, it emerges to  mate . Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the  solitary animals  meet. A newborn echidna grows rapidly on mother's milk and is expelled into the mother's burrow when it grows too large for the pouch. It leaves the burrow when it is around six months old. The species is found throughout Australia and in coastal and highland regions of eastern  New Guinea . It is not threatened with extinction, but human activities have reduced its distribution in Australia. This photograph shows a  Tasmanian short-beaked echidna  ( T. a. setosus ), a subspecies of the short-beaked echidna, near  Scottsdale, Tasmania .
