>Ruddigore  is a  comic opera  in two acts, with music by  Arthur Sullivan  and a libretto by  W. S. Gilbert . The tenth of  fourteen comic operas  written together by  Gilbert and Sullivan , it was first performed by the  D'Oyly Carte Opera Company  at the  Savoy Theatre  in London in 1887. Some critics and audience members initially felt that  Ruddygore  (its original title) did not measure up to its predecessor,  The Mikado . After changes, including respelling the title, it achieved a run of 288 performances and was profitable. This 1887 illustration by  Amédée Forestier  depicts scenes and characters from  Ruddygore  for  The Illustrated London News . Since D'Oyly Carte revived the piece in 1920, it has been regularly performed.
