>Pontia edusa , also known as the eastern Bath white, is a butterfly in the family  Pieridae . It is found from southeastern Europe (southern France, Italy, Corsica, Sardinia) up to central Europe and the Middle East in Iran and Iraq. It is a migrant which can also be encountered in Belgium, Holland, northern Germany and Poland, in the Baltic states and in southern Sweden and Norway. It resides in open grassy or flowery areas, in stony or rocky places and in roadsides, especially where the host plants grow, at an altitude of up to 2,300 metres (7,500 ft). This  P. edusa  butterfly was photographed near the  Elbe  in  Rühstädt , Germany.
