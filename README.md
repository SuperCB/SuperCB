>The  Argentine real  was the currency of Argentina between 1813 and 1881. From 1822, it was subdivided into ten décimos. The sol was also issued during this period and was equal to the real, while the peso was worth eight reales and the escudo was worth sixteen reales. This 1836 eight-escudo  gold coin  was issued by the  Argentine Confederation , a predecessor state of modern Argentina, featuring a portrait of the Argentine politician and general  Juan Manuel de Rosas  on the obverse, and a depiction of a mountain with crossed flags and cannons on the reverse. Only six of these coins are known to exist; this one forms part of the  National Numismatic Collection  at the  Smithsonian Institution .
