>Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin  (1900–1979) was a British-born American  astronomer  and  astrophysicist  who proposed in her 1925  doctoral  thesis that  stars  were composed primarily of  hydrogen  and  helium . Her groundbreaking conclusion was initially rejected because it contradicted the scientific wisdom of the time, which held that there were no significant elemental differences between the  Sun  and Earth. Independent observations eventually proved she was correct. Her work on the nature of variable stars was foundational to modern astrophysics.
