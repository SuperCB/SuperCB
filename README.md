>The  blue-billed duck  ( Oxyura australis ) is a small Australian  stiff-tailed duck , with both the male and female growing to a length of 40 centimetres (16 in). The male has a slate-blue bill which changes to bright-blue during the breeding season, which gives the duck its common name. The male has deep chestnut  plumage  during breeding season, reverting to a dark grey. The female retains black plumage with brown tips all year round. The duck is  endemic  to Australia's  temperate  regions, inhabiting natural inland  wetlands  and also artificial wetlands, such as sewage ponds, in large numbers. It can be difficult to observe due to its  cryptic  nature during its breeding season through autumn and winter. The male duck exhibits a complex mating ritual. The species is  omnivorous , with a preference for small aquatic  invertebrates . This male blue-billed duck was photographed near  Penrith, New South Wales , in 2020.
