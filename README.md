>In the Loge , also known as  At the Opera , is an 1878  Impressionist  painting by the American artist  Mary Cassatt . The  oil-on-canvas  work depicts a  bourgeois  woman in a  box  at an opera house looking through her  opera glasses , while a man in the background looks at her from a different box. The woman's costume and fan identify her upper-class status. Art historians see the painting as a commentary on the role of gender, looking, and power in the social spaces of the 19th century. The painting is now at the  Museum of Fine Arts, Boston , which also holds a preliminary drawing for the work.
