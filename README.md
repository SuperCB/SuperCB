>The Red Cape , also known as  Madame Monet  or  The Red Kerchief , is an  oil-on-canvas  snowscape by the French  Impressionist  artist  Claude Monet . Painted around 1868 to 1873, it depicts Monet's wife,  Camille , dressed in a red cape, passing outside a window as seen from inside a house. Monet created the painting while living in  Argenteuil  and the solitary setting at his home there allowed him to paint in relative peace, as well as spend time with his family. It is Monet's only known snowscape painting featuring Camille.  The Red Cape  is now in the collection of the  Cleveland Museum of Art  in Ohio, United States.
