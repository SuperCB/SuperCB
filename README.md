>The  bombing of Gaza  is an ongoing aerial bombardment campaign on the  Gaza Strip  by the  Israeli Air Force  during the  Israel–Hamas war . During the bombing, which began on 7 October 2023 after  a Hamas-led attack on Israel , airstrikes have damaged Palestinian mosques,  schools ,  hospitals ,  refugee camps , and  civilian infrastructure . The campaign has been compared to other major historical bombing campaigns, including the  bombings of Dresden  and  Tokyo  during  World War II . This photograph shows damage following an Israeli airstrike on the neighborhood of  Rimal  in  Gaza City  on 9 October 2023.
