>A  ghillie suit  is a type of  camouflage  clothing designed to resemble the background environment, such as foliage. Typically, it is a net or cloth garment covered in loose strips of burlap ( hessian ), cloth,  twine ,  or jute sometimes made to look like leaves and twigs, and optionally augmented with foliage from the area.  Military personnel ,  police ,  hunters , and  nature photographers  may wear a ghillie suit to blend into their surroundings and to conceal themselves from enemies or targets. The suit gives the wearer's outline a three-dimensional breakup, rather than a linear one. When manufactured correctly, the suit will move in the wind in the same way as surrounding foliage. Some ghillie suits are made with light and breathable material that allows a person to wear a shirt underneath. This photograph of a wildlife photographer in a ghillie suit, standing and holding a camera, was taken in a forest in the  Jura Mountains  near  Marchissy , Switzerland.
