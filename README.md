>Pomacanthus maculosus , commonly known as the yellowbar angelfish, is a species in the marine angelfish family,  Pomacanthidae , found in the western Indian Ocean and, more recently, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. It has a deep and compressed body with a small mouth that is equipped with small bristle-like teeth. The background colour of adults is brownish blue with each scale having a blue margin creating the impression that it is predominantly blue. There is an uneven, yellow bar close to the centre of the flanks with dark blue, vertically elongated spots towards the head. The species is occasionally collected for the aquarium trade and has also been recorded on sale as food in fish markets. This  P. maculosus  fish was photographed in  Ras Muhammad National Park  in the Red Sea off the coast of the  Sinai Peninsula  in Egypt.
