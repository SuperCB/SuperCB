>Chlamys varia , also known as the variegated scallop, is a small bivalve mollusc in the  scallop  family, Pectinidae. It occurs in the  North Sea , the  English Channel , the northeastern  Atlantic Ocean  and the  Red Sea , living at depths of up to around 100 m (330 ft) along coastal rocky areas. It typically lives under boulders or among the  holdfasts  of seaweeds. The shell of  Chlamys varia  comes in a range of colours and variegated patterns including white, pink, red, orange, yellow, or purple, and anything in between. Both valves are convex, rounded or oval, and symmetrical except for the ears on either side of the  umbo . The shell does not usually exceed 6 cm (2.4 in) in length. This  C. varia  shell, with left and right valves shown, was found in the  Adriatic Sea  near Italy.
