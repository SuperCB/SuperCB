>The  red-tailed squirrel  ( Sciurus granatensis ) is a species of  tree squirrel . It is found in Central and South America – including Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela – and the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago and  Margarita . It has also been introduced and is invasive in Cuba, but this is a small population found around some parts of the margin of Rio Almendares in Havana that escaped from the Havana Zoo. This is a common squirrel with a stable population and a vast range consisting of different habitats, including human-influenced environments, thus it is not thought to be under threat. This male red-tailed squirrel was photographed in the  Caldas Department  in Colombia.
