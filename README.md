>Silver certificates  are a type of  representative money  issued between 1878 and 1964 in the United States as part of  its circulation of paper currency . They were produced in response to  silver agitation  by citizens who were angered by the  Coinage Act of 1873 , which had effectively placed the United States on a  gold standard . Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in  Federal Reserve Notes  and are thus obsolete, but they remain  legal tender  at their face value and hence are still an accepted form of currency. This  five-dollar bill , a 1953 silver certificate bearing the first serial number of a printing of 339,600,000 banknotes, is part of the  National Numismatic Collection  at the  Smithsonian Institution 's  National Museum of American History . It features a portrait of President  Abraham Lincoln  on the obverse and the facade of the  Lincoln Memorial  in Washington, D.C., on the reverse.
