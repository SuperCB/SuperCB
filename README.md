>The  Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital  (also known as USPHS Hospital #43) was a  United States Public Health Service  hospital on  Ellis Island  in  New York Harbor  that operated from 1902 to 1951. It is part of the  Statue of Liberty National Monument . The hospital had two functions: treating immigrants who were ill upon arrival, and treating immigrants with conditions that were prohibited by immigration laws. These latter patients were stabilized and often sent back to their home countries. More than 275,000 patients were treated at Ellis Island; there were approximately 4,000 fatalities and 350 babies were born there. Efforts to restore the hospital buildings and other structures on the island are being made by the non-profit organization  Save Ellis Island . This photograph depicts a window in the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, decorated in 2014 by the French artist  JR  with reproductions of photographs of immigrants at the hospital.
