>The  martial eagle  ( Polemaetus bellicosus ) is a large  eagle  native to sub-Saharan Africa. A species of the booted eagle subfamily ( Aquilinae ), it has feathering over its  tarsus . One of the largest and most powerful species of booted eagle, it is a fairly opportunistic predator that varies its prey selection between mammals, birds and reptiles. It is one of a few eagle species known to hunt primarily from a high soar, by stooping on its quarry. Currently, the species is classified as  endangered  by the  International Union for Conservation of Nature . This martial eagle was photographed in the  Matetsi  safari area in Zimbabwe.
