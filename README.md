>Horatius Cocles  was an officer in the army of the early  Roman Republic  who famously defended the  Pons Sublicius  from the invading army of  Etruscan  king  Lars Porsena  of  Clusium  in the late 6th century BC, during the  war between Rome and Clusium . By defending the narrow end of the bridge, he and his companions were able to hold off the attacking army long enough to allow other Romans to destroy the bridge behind him, blocking the Etruscans' advance and saving the city. This fanciful engraving of Cocles was produced in 1586 by the German-born Dutch printmaker  Hendrick Goltzius . The full-length portrait shows him holding a raised sword in his right hand and a shield in his left. In the lower right of the background, Cocles takes on an army by himself.
