>The  hyacinth macaw  ( Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus ) is a  parrot  in the family  Psittacidae , native to central and eastern  South America . With a length of around 1 metre (3 feet), it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is also the largest  macaw  and the largest flying parrot species. The hyacinth macaw mostly nests in  manduvi trees ; these trees rely on the  toco toucan  for the majority of their distribution of seeds, but that bird also feeds on a sizeable proportion of the hyacinth macaw's eggs. Habitat loss and the trapping of wild birds for the pet trade have taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, so the species is classified as  vulnerable  on the  IUCN Red List . This hyacinth macaw eating a nut was photographed by the  Rio Negro , a river in the  Pantanal  in southwestern Brazil.
