>The  sedge warbler  ( Acrocephalus schoenobaenus ) is a passerine bird in the  Acrocephalidae  family, the reed warblers. It is a medium-sized warbler with a brown, streaked back and wings and a distinct pale  supercilium . Sedge warblers are  migratory , crossing the  Sahara  to get from their European and Asian breeding grounds to spend winter in Africa. The male's song is composed of chattering phrases and can include mimicry of other species. The species is mostly  insectivorous . This sedge warbler was photographed in  Otmoor RSPB reserve  in  Oxfordshire , England.
