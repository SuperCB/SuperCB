>Henry Highland Garnet  (1815–1882) was an American  abolitionist , minister, educator and orator. Having escaped as a child  from slavery in Maryland with his family, he grew up in New York City. He was educated at the  African Free School  and other institutions, and went on to join the  American Anti-Slavery Society , delivering abolitionist speeches such as the 1843 "Call to Rebellion". On February 12, 1865, Garnet delivered a sermon in the  U.S. House of Representatives  while it was not in session, becoming the first African American to speak in that chamber. This photograph is an  albumen silver print  of Garnet, taken in around 1881.
