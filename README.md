>Street football , or street soccer, is an informal variation on the game of  association football , typically played in outdoor urban settings such as streets, playgrounds and car parks. The term encompasses a variety of different formats, which do not necessarily follow the requirements of a formal game of football, such as a large  field , field markings, goal apparatus and corner flags, eleven  players  per team, or match officials ( referee  and  assistant referees ). Street football is often played as a  pick-up game , without fixed timing and with players joining and leaving at any point. Many international professional players learned to play football on the street, including  Diego Maradona ,  Johan Cruyff ,  Pelé ,  Giuseppe Meazza ,  Eamon Dunphy ,  Eusébio ,  Dejan Savićević , and  Cristiano Ronaldo . This 2017 photograph shows boys playing street football on  al-Mu'izz Street  in  Cairo , Egypt, by the exterior wall of the  al-Hakim Mosque .
