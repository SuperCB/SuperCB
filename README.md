>Haliotis kamtschatkana , also known as the northern abalone or pinto abalone, is a species of large  sea snail  in the family  Haliotidae , the  abalones . It is found in  kelp beds  and in rocky areas in the northeast Pacific Ocean, from  Salisbury Sound , Alaska, along the coasts of Canada and the United States to  Baja California , Mexico. Its distribution also includes Korea. The pinto abalone has an adult  shell  size of approximately 8 cm (3.1 in) but can occasionally grow as large as 15 cm (5.9 in). The rather thin shell is flattened and ear-shaped. The surface is covered with uneven spiral cords, often almost obsolete, and strongly elevated undulations or lumps. This image shows five views of a  H. kamtschatkana  shell found in Baja California.
