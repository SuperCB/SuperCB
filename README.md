>The  Basilica of St Paul  is a Catholic parish church in  Rabat, Malta , located on the edge of the site of the Roman city of  Melite . The present church was built between 1653 and 1658, replacing a church that was completed in 1578. It was constructed with funds from the noblewoman  Cosmana Navarra , on plans prepared by  Francesco Buonamici . The final stages were completed by  Lorenzo Gafà . It was elevated to the status of a  minor basilica  in 2020. The church features a grotto where, according to tradition,  Paul the Apostle  lived and preached during his three-month stay in Malta in AD 60. This photograph shows the facade of the Basilica of St Paul in 2021.
