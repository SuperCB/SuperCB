>A  rainbow  is an  optical phenomenon  that can occur under certain  meteorological  conditions. It is caused by  refraction ,  internal reflection  and  dispersion  of light in water droplets resulting in a continuous  spectrum  of light appearing in the sky. The rainbow takes the form of a multicoloured circular  arc . Although a rainbow spans a continuous spectrum of colours, it is traditionally assigned a discrete sequence, with  red ,  orange ,  yellow ,  green ,  blue ,  indigo , and  violet  as the most common list. The rainbow inspired the  rainbow flag , a symbol of  LGBT pride  and  Pride Month . This portion of a rainbow, appearing to rise from a lakeside forest, was photographed in 2005 in  Jasper National Park  in  Alberta , Canada.
