>W. S. Gilbert  (1836–1911) was an English dramatist,  librettist  and illustrator best known for his fourteen  comic operas  produced in collaboration with the composer  Arthur Sullivan . The most popular  Gilbert and Sullivan  collaborations include  H.M.S. Pinafore ,  The Pirates of Penzance  and  The Mikado , one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre. These  Savoy operas  continue to be performed regularly today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond. Gilbert's creative output included more than 75 plays and libretti, numerous stories, poems, lyrics and various other comic and serious pieces. His plays and  realistic  style of stage direction inspired other dramatists, including  Oscar Wilde  and  George Bernard Shaw , and his comic operas inspired the development of American musical theatre, especially influencing Broadway writers. The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote of Gilbert: "Till one actually came to know the man, one shared the opinion ... that he was a gruff, disagreeable person; but nothing could be less true of the really great humorist. He had ... precious little use for fools ... but he was at heart as kindly and lovable a man as you could wish to meet." This  cabinet card  of Gilbert was produced by the photographic studio  Elliott & Fry  around 1882–1883.
